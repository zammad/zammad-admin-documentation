ðŸš› Migrating existing accounts
   As google has postponed switching to xAuth we decided to not yet show migration warnings. 
   We will provide an easy migration button in future Zammad versions - you'll have enough time to 
   switch without issues!

   .. hint:: Currently it's necessary to **Delete** accounts from your Email channel before adding 
      the gmail account within the Google channel. If you have a lot of aliases, this might be very 
      inconvienent for you.

:doc:`accounts/account-setup`
   Use the **Add Account** dialog to connect your account.

.. note:: ðŸ¤” **Huh?! No notification channel for Google??**

   Zammad currently doesn't provide a notification channel for gmail accounts, we suggest using the 
   :doc:`regular email channel </channels/email/accounts/email-notification>` for notification channels. 
   This also reduces the risk to hit `Google's sending limits <https://support.google.com/a/answer/166852?hl=en>`_.
