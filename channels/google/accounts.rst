Email Notification
   This option is **not available on Google channels**.

   To configure the outgoing mail provider for system notifications,
   use a :doc:`regular email notification channel </channels/email/accounts>`.
   (Self-hosted installations only.)

   .. note:: ðŸ¤” **Why?**

      Using a Gmail account for automated, outgoing messages is risky:
      users who exceed Googleâ€™s `email sending limits
      <https://support.google.com/a/answer/166852>`_
      can have their accounts suspended.
