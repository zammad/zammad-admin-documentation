ðŸš› Migrate an Existing Email Channel
   If youâ€™ve already added your Gmail account as a regular email channel,
   youâ€™ll have to convert it to a Google channel eventually:
   Google is planning to end support for simple password authentication
   in third-party email clients (like Zammad).
   **But thereâ€™s no rush just yet**.

   Upcoming versions of Zammad will feature an automated migration wizard
   to help you make the switch, and itâ€™ll be available
   well before Google officially pulls the plug on password auth.

   .. hint:: If youâ€™d rather just do it manually today,
      just remember to **delete the email channel for your Gmail account**
      (and all its associated aliases) before re-adding it here.

:doc:`accounts/account-setup`
   Use the **Add Account** dialog to connect your account.

   Send and receive email at **additional email addresses**,
   all through the same mailbox/account.

Email Notification
   This option is **not available on Google channels**.

   To configure the outgoing mail provider for system notifications,
   use a :doc:`regular email channel </channels/email/accounts>`.
   (Self-hosted installations only.)

   .. note:: ðŸ¤” **Why?**

      Using a Gmail account for automated, outgoing messages is risky:
      users who exceed Googleâ€™s `email sending limits
      <https://support.google.com/a/answer/166852>`_
      can have their accounts suspended.
