Secondary Addresses
===================

Secondary addresses (also known as *aliases*) allow you to send emails
with a different ‚ÄúFrom:‚Äù address from the one on the account.

   Once you add a secondary address,
   you can configure a group to start sending emails with it.

.. warning:: üßê **Add your alias to your gmail account beforehand.**

   Google requires you to verify your alias. If you add aliases to Zammad that you may not 
   send from, Google does deny sending this email!

   .. hint:: **G-Suite users**

      G-Suite accounts can't just add aliases on their own - the admin has to add the alias to 
      the account. After that you can use the required alias.

Your email provider may also be set up to *receive incoming messages*
for many addresses in the same mailbox.
If this is the case, be sure to add your alternate inbox addresses here.
