   Use the **+ Add** or **Edit** buttons
   to set up secondary addresses on this account.

Enabled / Disabled
   Disabling an account temporarily prevents Zammad from importing its messages.

   This may be necessary during scheduled maintenance
   or when migrating your installation to a new host. 

   .. note:: üìÆ Disabling an account disables *outgoing* messages for it, as well.

Delete
   Deleting an account removes its configuration from Zammad entirely.

   .. note:: ‚ö† **No Additional Steps Required**

      Unlike the Email channel, Zammad removes your configured email addresses 
      together with your account if you delete it.

      Groups need an assigned an address to send outgoing emails.
      If you delete a group‚Äôs assigned address, agents belonging to 
      that group won‚Äôt be able to send emails until you assign it a new one.
