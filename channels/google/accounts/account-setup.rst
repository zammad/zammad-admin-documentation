Account Setup
=============

After you've :doc:`registered Zammad as an OAuth app <register-app>`
in your Google Developer settings,
you can begin connecting Gmail accounts to Zammad.

‚ò†Ô∏è **But first, a word of warning!**
The import process does things you might not expect:

.. danger::
   * By default, Zammad will **delete all emails** in your inbox
     during the import process. Use the *Keep Messages on Server* setting to
     :ref:`disable this behavior <google-keep-messages-on-server>`.
   * Zammad will send an auto-reply message
     to every email it imports (including the old ones!).
     Make sure to :doc:`disable this behavior </manage/trigger>`
     prior adding an email account and to turn it back on once all your
     messages have been imported.

üöõ Migrate an Existing Email Channel
------------------------------------

If you've already added your Google account as a regular email channel,
you'll have to convert it to a Google channel eventually:
Google is planning to end support for simple password authentication
in third-party email clients (like Zammad).

Please refer the :doc:`migrate-from-email-channel` guide.

Add a New Account

Click **Add Account** to connect your Gmail / G Suite accounts to Zammad.
You will be redirected to a Google sign-in and confirmation page.

Any aliases registered in your Gmail settings will be imported automatically.

   Google has a stringent verification process
   to protect users from third-party websites that use OAuth to access their
   data. Since you *are* the third-party website here,
   you can safely ignore this warning.

Channel
^^^^^^^

.. _google-folder:

Folder
   Specify which folder (or *label*) to fetch from,
   or leave empty to fetch from ``INBOX``.

   If specifying a nested folder, be sure to use the full path;
   *e.g.,* ``Inquiries/Tech-Support``.

   .. _google-keep-messages-on-server:

Keep messages on server
   Specify what happens to your emails after Zammad imports them:

   * ``no`` Zammad deletes all imported messages

   * ``yes`` Zammad marks imported messages as read

     (With this option, Zammad will only import unread messages.
     This means Zammad may miss messages if the mailbox is externally modified.)

   .. note:: ü§î **Why does Zammad delete messages by default?**

      If you never clean out your inbox,
      it'll eventually reach its storage limit,
      and your mail server will start **rejecting incoming messages**.
      Most Zammad users never even look at their inbox once it's set up,
      so they rely on Zammad to keep it clean for them.

      If you choose **yes** here, remember that it's your responsibility
      to clean out your inbox from time to time
      to keep it below its storage limit.

After adding the account
   After successfully adding the Microsoft 365 mail account, you can adjust
   the default group Zammad is going to assign incoming new tickets to.

   Only **active** groups will be displayed.

   Changing this setting will not reassign existing tickets to the new group.

Troubleshooting
---------------

I successfully added my account, but Zammad isn't fetching new email
   If you specified a :ref:`custom folder/label to fetch from <google-folder>`,
   are you sure incoming mail is arriving in that folder?
