.. warning:: ğŸ‘€ **Secondary addresses must be added and verified in your Gmail settings first.**

   Gmail has its own process for adding and verifying aliases
   (under **Settings > Accounts and Import > Send mail as**).
   If you add an alias here before adding it in your Gmail settings,
   Google will refuse to dispatch it.

   G Suite users may need to contact their administrators
   in order to add aliases in their Gmail settings.
