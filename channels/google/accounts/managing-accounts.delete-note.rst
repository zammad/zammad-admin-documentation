.. note:: 🧹 **Additional Steps Required**

   Groups need an assigned an address to send outgoing emails.
   If you delete a group's assigned address,
   agents belonging to that group won't be able to send emails
   until you assign it a new one.

   (There's no need to manage orphaned email addresses like you would on an
   email channel. In Google channels, aliases are connected to your Gmail
   account, which means they can be imported and purged automatically.)
