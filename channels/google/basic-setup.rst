Basic Setup
===========

To set up a new Gmail or G Suite channel in Zammad, you first have
to create an **OAuth app** in Google's Cloud console. Then you can connect
Zammad with your Google account and add as many Gmail accounts to Zammad as
you want, using only active Gmail browser sessions (no usernames or passwords
required).

If you already set up Google email channels in Zammad, you can easily
migrate them to a Google channel. Follow the steps below but skip the step
"Add Account" and proceed with :ref:`migrate-channel`.

.. _register-oauth-google:

Register an OAuth App
---------------------

Sign in to the `Google Cloud console <https://console.cloud.google.com/>`_.
You should see a dashboard where you can add a new project. If you already
have an app which is in production, create a new one and follow the steps
below.

Create an OAuth Consent Screen
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the left sidebar of your project's "APIs & Services" section, select
OAuth consent screen and provide the requested information.

.. figure:: /images/channels/google/oauth-consent-screen.png
   :alt: Screenshot shows OAuth consent screen creation in Google Cloud console

In the first screen, select "Internal" as User Type and click on "Create".

Provide the following information in the next screen:

- **App name**: enter a suitable name for this app
- **User support email**: select an email address from the dropdown
- **Authorized domain**: the domain of your Zammad without http or https prefix
- **Developer contact information**: enter a valid email address

After entering the information, click on "Save and Continue". You should be
on the "Scopes" screen. Click on "Add or Remove Scopes" to see the dialog as in
the following screenshot.

.. figure:: /images/channels/google/add-api.png

   :alt: Screenshot with highlighted API selection

1. Enter ``https://mail.google.com`` in the "Manually add scopes" text field
2. Click on "Add to Table" to have it in the selectable scopes table above
3. Select it by checking the box
4. Confirm by clicking the "Update" button

Go on by clicking "Save and Continue". If your app is in "Testing" mode, add a
user as which you want to sign in to your Google account.
After that you see a summary screen where you can check the information.
Confirm by clicking the "Back to Dashboard" button and go on with creating
credentials for your app.

Create Credentials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Select "Credentials" in the left sidebar, click on "‚ûï Create Credentials" and
choose "OAuth client ID".

.. figure:: /images/channels/google/add-credentials-oauth.png
   :alt: Screenshot shows credentials screen with highlighted elements
   :align: center

Select "Web application" as Application type, give it a name and enter your
redirect URL.

.. figure:: /images/channels/google/oauth-credentials-dialog.png
   :alt:
   :align: center

The redirect URL is basically the domain of your Zammad instance, extended with
``/api/v1/external_credentials/google/callback``.

You can even find the complete redirect URL in Zammad's admin area
under Channels > Google. Click on "Configure App" and find your URL under
"Your callback URL".

.. figure:: /images/channels/google/configure-app-dialog.png
   :alt: Screenshot shows Zammad's configuration dialog for a Google app
   :align: center
   :scale: 70%

Click on "Create" after inserting the information. You will see a dialog with
your client ID and client secret. You need both of them in the next step for
configuring Zammad to connect it to Google.

Configure App
-------------

Go to Channels > Google in Zammad's admin area and click on "Configure App".
Insert the client ID and client secret which you got in the step before.

.. figure:: /images/channels/google/client-id-secret.png
   :alt: Screenshot shows dialogs from Google and Zammad with client ID and secret
   :scale: 70%
   :align: center

Confirm by clicking the "Submit" button. Now you can add a Google account as
channel in Zammad, see next step.

Add Account
-----------

If you already have Google email channels, you can skip this step and head over
to :ref:`migrate-channel`.

After you've registered Zammad as an OAuth app, you can connect Gmail accounts
to Zammad.

‚ò†Ô∏è **But first, a word of warning!**
The import process does things you might not expect:

.. danger::
   * By default, Zammad will **delete all emails** in your inbox
     during the import process. Use the *Keep Messages on Server* setting to
     :ref:`disable this behavior <google-keep-messages-on-server>`.
   * Zammad will send an auto-reply message
     to every email it imports (including the old ones!).
     Make sure to :doc:`disable this behavior </manage/trigger>`
     prior adding an email account and to turn it back on once all your
     messages have been imported.

To connect you Google account, click on "Add Account" in Zammad. You will be
redirected to a consent dialog. Click through the screens and and make sure
to select the desired Google account as well as to grant the permission for
email handling as you can see in the following screenshot.

.. figure:: /images/channels/google/consent-screen-email-permission.png
   :alt: Screenshot shows Google's consent screen with checked email permission
   :scale: 50%
   :align: center

After clicking on "Continue", you are redirected to Zammad where you can see a
dialog for specifying a folder and if you want to keep messages on the server.

.. _google-folder:

Folder
   Specify which folder (or *label*) to fetch from,
   or leave empty to fetch from ``INBOX``.
   If specifying a nested folder, be sure to use the full path,
   e.g. ``Inquiries/Tech-Support``.

   .. _google-keep-messages-on-server:

Keep messages on server
   Specify what happens to your emails after Zammad imports them:

   * ``no``: Zammad deletes all imported messages
   * ``yes``: Zammad marks imported messages as read. With this option,
     Zammad will only import unread messages. This means Zammad may miss
     messages if the mailbox is externally modified.

   .. note:: ü§î **Why does Zammad delete messages by default?**

      If you never clean out your inbox,
      it'll eventually reach its storage limit,
      and your mail server will start **rejecting incoming messages**.
      Most Zammad users never even look at their inbox once it's set up,
      so they rely on Zammad to keep it clean for them.

      If you choose **yes** here, remember that it's your responsibility
      to clean out your inbox from time to time
      to keep it below its storage limit.


After successfully adding the Google account, you can adjust
the default group Zammad is going to assign incoming new tickets to.

.. figure:: /images/channels/google/change-destination-group.png
   :alt: Location of "Destination Group" setting for existing accounts
   :scale: 70%
   :align: center

Only **active** groups will be displayed. Changing this setting will not
reassign existing tickets to the new group.

.. _migrate-channel:

Migrate from Email Channel
--------------------------

Convert Email Channel to Google Channel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Zammad provides a migration logic that allows you to migrate existing Google
accounts from an email channel into a Google channel.

.. note:: üßê **Zammad is expecting specific settings**

   In order for Zammad to display the migration option, it expects the channels
   hostname to be ``imap.gmail.com`` for IMAP and ``smtp.gmail.com`` for SMTP.

The easiest way to start the migration is to :ref:`register-oauth-google` for
your Google accounts before migrating. However, if you don't, Zammad will ask
you to provide your app credentials before allowing you to continue.

If you're ready to go, simply click on the *Migrate now!* button in the red
banner of the email channel in question. Zammad will redirect you to
Google and request you to authenticate and consent to said account.

After you pressed next you'll be redirect to Zammad's Google channel overview.
Your channel, if successful, is now migrated to an Google channel.

   :align: center

Rolling Back the Migration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In case something went wrong, Zammad allows you to roll back the migration
for up to 7 days. For this time period Zammad will remember your original
credentials and restore it if needed. These information will be removed
entirely after 7 days.

Troubleshooting
---------------

My OAuth credentials stopped working
   Did you recently change your Google password? Google invalidates all your
   OAuth tokens whenever you change it.

How to use the Gmail account for outgoing system notifications?
   On **subscription/cloud-hosted instances**, you can't do that.
   Notifications will always come from
   ‚ÄúNotification Master <noreply\@your.zammad.domain>‚Äù.

   On **self-hosted instances**, we still don't recommend it.
   Using a Gmail account for automated, outgoing messages is risky:
   users who exceed Google's `email sending limits
   <https://support.google.com/a/answer/166852>`_
   can have their accounts suspended.

   Set up a generic :doc:`email channel </channels/email/index>` instead and
   use the :ref:`Email Notification <email-notification>` setting.

I successfully added my account, but Zammad isn't fetching new emails
   If you specified a :ref:`custom folder/label to fetch from <google-folder>`,
   are you sure incoming mail is arriving in that folder?
