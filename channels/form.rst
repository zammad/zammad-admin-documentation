Forms
*****

Feedback or contact forms are used on websites quite often.
Usually they will generate an email which will be sent to somebody who forwards
it and so on. With Zammad it's quite easy to integrate these forms into your
website and directly generate tickets with them. In just 2 minutes.

Limitations
-----------

Please note the following limitations:

   * The fields provided by the form are limited to the following:

     * Name
     * Email
     * Message
     * Attachment upload (optional)
     * Checkbox for custom agreement text (optional)

   * As of now only one dedicated form per instance is possible

Settings
--------

Zammad comes with certain settings for forms.

Active
   By default the form channel is *inactive*.
   Use the switch in front of "Form" to activate this channel.

   Forms will not be displayed on your website if the channel is not active.
   This does not affect the form *preview* on the channels setting page.

Group selection for ticket creation
   The group you set here defines where tickets should be created if they're
   supplied by Zammad's web form.

Designer
--------

This section helps you to configure your form in the channel's scope.
If you're happy with what you've chosen, you're provided with the code you
need to copy to your website.

.. warning::

   The designer's changes *are not* stored anywhere in Zammad.
   This means that the provided source code needs to be copied every time
   you change settings here.

         of your form.

So let's talk about the options the designer provides.

Title of the form
   Choose how the heading of the form should be called.
   This setting is only relevant if you choose to display the form title in the
   form.

   Default: ``Feedback Form``

Name of form submit button
   If Zammad's default display name of the submit button does not fit, you can
   provide your own wording with this option. It will be used every time the
   form is shown.

Message after sending form
   After your user pressed the submit button, they will be provided with
   a message containing the ticket number of the newly created ticket.

   Default *after* sending a form will look like so:

   .. code-block:: text

      Thank you for your inquiry (#31015)!
      We'll contact you as soon as possible.

Options
   Zammad provides the following additional configuration options for your form.

   Enable debugging for implementation
      This option activates detailed debug information in your browser's
      developer tools console.

      .. warning:: This option *should not* be active on productive forms!

   Show title in form
      This setting belongs to the setting ``Title of the form`` and will
      provide the form title within the form dialogue if selected.

   Start modal dialog for form
      If selected, the form will be opened in a modal by clicking a button.
      Not selecting this option allows you to natively integrate the form within
      your website's body.

      No matter what you select here, the form *is always* loaded completely
      if your user browses the page containing the form.

      This option is set by default.

   Don't load CSS for the form You need to generate your own CSS for the form.
      By default Zammad's form comes with basic CSS. This may not fit your
      website's design or even interfere with it.

      Selecting this option allows you to freely design the form without having
      to overwrite existing directives.

   Add attachment option to upload
      Allows your user to upload **one attachment** to the form.

      The allowed attachment sizes *is not* limited. The only limitation that
      applies is your web servers upload limit.

      .. hint:: **SaaS only**

         If you're with Zammad hosted, attachments are limited by the
         package you've chosen.

   Add agreement text before submit
      If enabled, this will allow you define a text that the form will display
      together with a checkbox. Thereby you can ensure your form conforms
      to legal requirements, e.g. by providing data privacy notes that the user has
      to accept before submitting the form.

         :alt: Screencast showing a sample on how to configure the agreement
               text setting

         Zammad provides a free text form with limited capabilities.
         Use the *ðŸ”— Weblink* button to add links to marked text passages.

         This allows you to link e.g. to your data privacy or ToS information.

Preview
~~~~~~~

Below the form options, Zammad provides a preview section to visualize the
settings you've just chosen. By default you'll see a button named *Feedback*.

Clicking on the button will open the form modal. If the form channel is set
to active, you already are able to create tickets even from this preview mode.

Requirements
------------

The requirement section provides you with everything you need in order to
apply Zammad's web form to your website. It basically consists of two parts.

Header section
   The first code block provides you with Zammad's current jQuery dependency.
   This script section usually belongs to your website's header section.

   The channel form suggests the following script tag which loads the
   javascript libary required **from an external site**. This may not
   suite your local requirements. You can use locally hosted jQuery version,
   **however** the version is fixed.

   ``<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>``

   .. warning::

      Do not mix jQuery versions - it's likely to break something.

Body section
   The second code block is the actual code required for your form to run.
   It is updated automatically when changing settings in the
   designer above.

   The first line containing ``id="zammad-feedback-form"`` highly depends on
   the settings selected above. This part belongs into the place you actually
   want the form or form button to appear.

   The rest can either be placed at the same level or somewhere else on the
   same page.

   .. note::

      These statements *highly* depend on your website.
      As you're responsible for your own website, you're on your own
      figuring out where exactly to place what.

Take the Zammad website as an example, the embedded form version can look
like the following if you apply custom CSS to it.

Potential Spam Issue
--------------------

The Form function could be abused by sending a high amount of
messages / tickets to your Zammad instance. If you do not use Zammad Forms:
**disable** them.

But don't worry! Zammad does limit the maximum count of created tickets based on
different criteria. It also ensures that the email address being used is valid
(with MX-Check on the email's domain).

.. list-table:: Form settings to limit ticket creation
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20, 10, 20

   * - Option
     - Default value
     - Description
   * - ``form_ticket_create_by_ip_per_hour``
     - ``20``
     - Limits ticket creation per IP and hour to 20 tickets
   * - ``form_ticket_create_by_ip_per_day``
     - ``240``
     - Limits ticket creation per IP and day to 240 tickets
   * - ``form_ticket_create_per_day``
     - ``5000``
     - Limits ticket creation for forms to 5000 tickets per day


.. hint::

   | You can change these default values. Please keep in mind, that setting
     those values higher might lead to problems in term of created tickets.
   |
   | Please note that the following changes require console access to your Zammad host.

**Change the ticket creation per IP and hour to 10**::

   rails> Setting.set('form_ticket_create_by_ip_per_hour','10')

**Change the ticket creation per IP and hour to 50**::

   rails> Setting.set('form_ticket_create_by_ip_per_day','50')

**Change the ticket creation per day to 500**::

   rails> Setting.set('form_ticket_create_per_day','500')


Further options to make it harder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another way to make it harder for bots to automate against your Zammad instance
is to change the location of ``form.js``
( ``/opt/zammad/assets/form/form.js`` ).

Please keep in mind if you change the location of ``form.js`` (by e.g. copying)
that you need to ensure that your ``form.js`` stays up to date if you update
Zammad.

It's not recommended to delete form.js from it's location in that case, but to
forbid access to it via your web server configuration.
