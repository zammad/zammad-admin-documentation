Microsoft 365 Channels
======================

Zammad supports two ways of connecting to your M365 environment:

- Via :doc:`IMAP <m365-imap/index>`
- Via :doc:`Graph <m365-graph/index>`

Before trying to add a M365 channel to Zammad, make sure to use the right one.
You can configure them in the admin panel under
*Channels > Microsoft 365 IMAP Email* or *Channels > Microsoft 365 Graph Email*,
depending on which you want to use.
