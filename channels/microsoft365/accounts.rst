.. note:: ü§î **How do I use my Microsoft 365 account for outgoing system notifications?**

   On **subscription/cloud-hosted instances**, you can't.
   Notifications will always come from
   ‚ÄúNotification Master <noreply\@your.zammad.domain>‚Äù.

   On **self-hosted instances**, we still don't recommend it.
   Using a Microsoft account for automated, outgoing messages is risky:
   users who exceed Microsoft's
   `email sending limits <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-limits#receiving-and-sending-limits>`_
   can have their accounts suspended.

   Set up a generic :doc:`email channel </channels/email/index>` instead,
   then use the :ref:`Email Notification <email-notification>` setting.
