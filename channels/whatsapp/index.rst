========

Connect Zammad with a WhatsApp Business account so your customers can
reach out to you through WhatsApp. 🎉

.. warning::

   - The usage of **WhatsApp Cloud API** is mandatory to connect WhatsApp to
     Zammad. You won't be able to connect to WhatsApp in Zammad if you just use
     the WhatsApp Business *App*. Have a look
     `here <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api>`_
     for further information about the Cloud API.
   - There may be additional costs for you from Meta/WhatsApp side. Have a look
     at their
     `pricing page <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing>`_ to
     be safe from surprises.
   - This setup process can be very time consuming. You should have some time to
     follow this guide.

If you are already familiar with Meta's app creation process and their developer
console, you can directly jump to the setup page.
In all other cases, we strongly encourage you to read about the limitations
of this channel carefully and to follow the preparation steps first.
