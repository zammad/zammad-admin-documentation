WhatsApp
========

With the release of Zammad 6.3, you can now connect your Zammad with a
WhatsApp Business account, allowing your customers to reach out to you through
WhatsApp. 🎉

If you already dived deep into this topic, you can head to the setup guide.
If not, we strongly encourage you to read the prerequisites and limitations
of this channel carefully and to follow our tutorial for preparing your
setup.

We tried to keep it clear and created a separate sub-page for the necessary
steps on Meta/WhatsApp side.

.. warning::
   Please be aware that the usage of **WhatsApp Cloud API** is mandatory to
   connect WhatsApp to Zammad. You won't be able
   to connect to WhatsApp in Zammad if you just use the WhatsApp Business *App*.
   Have a look
   `here <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api>`_
   for further information about the Cloud API.

   There may be additional costs for you from Meta/WhatsApp side. Have a look
   at their
   `pricing page <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing>`_ to
   be safe from surprises.

   Be aware that if you go through the whole process, it is very time consuming.
   You should have some time to follow our preparation guide.
