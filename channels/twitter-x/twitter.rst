Twitter/X
=========

.. warning::

   *Updated: 08/2023*

   Please note: Currently, we keep naming it "Twitter" or "Twitter/X" in the
   documentation, as it is the quite common name and for better readability.
   Of course we mean just "X".

   ‚ö†Ô∏è Due to the current situation, there are some issues regarding the Twitter/X
   integration. Please see :doc:`twitter-x-note` for further details
   before reading on!

Zammad supports Twitter integration,
meaning you can send and receive tweets and DMs just like emails!

   Twitter tickets will show a üê¶ Twitter bird in the reply area. Just click on
   the reply button (as you would for an email) to tweet back.

.. note::
   To set it up, follow the steps below:

   1. Apply for a `Twitter Developer account <https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply/user>`_.

      for the Account Activity API.

1. Apply for a Twitter Developer Account
----------------------------------------

   This welcome page is displayed after completing the application for a
   Developer account.

You will need a regular Twitter account with a verified phone number
to apply for a `Twitter Developer account`_ (at https://developer.twitter.com).

During the application process, you will be asked
to **Describe in your own words what you are building**.
You may use the answer below::

   1. To manage customer service communications for our organization.
   2. No.
   3. Our use case involves posting original tweets in response to tweets and
      DMs we receive. We will not use the Twitter API to post or like ‚Äúcontent‚Äù.
   4. Our application will display individual tweets in their original form to
      authorized customer service agents of our organization only.

2. Create a New Twitter App for Zammad
--------------------------------------

.. figure:: /images/channels/apps.twitter.com_create_app_screen.png

   :align: center

   To create a new app, select **Apps** under your user menu, then click
   **Create an app**.

Once you have finished setting up your Developer account,
use it to `create a new Twitter app`_.
The following fields are **required:**

App name
   Must be unique *across all of Twitter.* No other developer account may
   create an app with the same name.

Application description
   Anything is fine here.

Website URL
   The URL of your Zammad instance.

Callback URLs
   ``https://<zammad_instance>/api/v1/external_credentials/twitter/callback``

   This URL is also visible in the **Connect Twitter App** dialog of your Zammad
   admin settings panel.

Tell us how this app will be used
   Anything is fine here. We suggest the following::

      This app will be used to manage Twitter communications between our
      customers and our organization's customer service agents on Zammad.

3. Set Your New App's Permissions
---------------------------------

      You will need all four keys/tokens later, so don't close this tab.

5. Set Up a Dev Environment
---------------------------

After creating your app, `set up a dev environment`_
for the Account Activity API.

   later, so don't forget it.

   4 and 5.

Zammad tickets.
