It's possible to put your Telegram bot communication into Zammad.
To do so, you need to follow these steps.

.. note::

   Your Zammad instance needs to be publicly available via HTTPS
   (we use Telegram WebHooks).

.. warning::

   ðŸ“Ž Zammad **cannot receive file attachments larger than 20MB** in
   Telegram messages.

   This is a hard limit imposed by the
   `Telegram Bot API <https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#getfile>`_.


Register a Telegram bot app
===========================

Register your Telegram bot via your Telegram client, see also 
`here <https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot>`_.
