It's possible to put your Telegram bot communication into Zammad. To do so, you need to follow these steps.

.. note:: Your Zammad instance needs to be publicly available via HTTPS (we use Telegram WebHooks).

.. warning:: 📎 Zammad **cannot receive file attachments larger than 20MB** in Telegram messages.

   This is a hard limit imposed by the `Telegram Bot API <https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#getfile>`_.

Register a Telegram bot app
===========================

Register your Telegram bot via your Telegram client, see also here: https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot
