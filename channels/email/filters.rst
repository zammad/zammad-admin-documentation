Postmaster filters allow you to match email headers
(e.g. ``From``, ``To``, ``Subject``, ``X-Spam-Flag`` etc.) and execute a set of
actions whenever Zammad's email parser encounters a matching email. The actions
will be applied to the ticket that is created or updated by this email. Here are
some examples of what is possible with filters:

Automatically dispatch tickets into certain groups:
  For example, tickets from ``amazon.com`` could automatically be dispatched to
  the Purchasing group.

  | From: contains: ``regex:(\.|@)amazon\.com``
  | Group: Purchasing

  .. note::

    Note that the Group action only has an effect when the matching email
    results in a new ticket. Zammad will not change the group of existing 
    tickets.

Automatically increase the priority of tickets from a VIP customer:
  | From: contains: ``ourvipcustomer@example.com``
  | Priority: 3 high

  .. note::

    Note that the Priority action only has an effect when the matching email
    results in a new ticket. Zammad will not change the priority of existing
    tickets.

Automatically tag and close spam tickets that have been marked as spam by anexternal spam filter (e.g. SpamAssassin):
  | X-Spam-Flag: contains: ``YES``
  | Tag: add: ``spam``
  | State: closed

  .. note::

    Note that the State action only has an effect when the matching email
    results in a new ticket. Zammad will not change the state of existing
    tickets. It will add the tag though if it missing, even if the mail is an
    update to an existing ticket.

The following actions are only effective when creating tickets:

  * Group
  * State
  * Priority
  * Owner

Different attributes of a filter can be combined with each other. Likewise,
the following actions can be combined. The supported matches are "contains"
and "contains not"; for advanced matching, you can use regular expressions by
prefixing the string with ``regex:``.

Note that Zammad matches against the full header, e.g. for a mail with
``From: Display Name <display.name@example.com>``, the ``From`` condition will
test against ``Display Name <display.name@example.com>``. This is especially
important when using anchored regular expressions;
``regex:^display\.name@example.com$`` would not match this mail!

It should be borne in mind that the combined attributes build on each other.
If a filter is no longer needed, it can either be temporarily set inactive or
deleted directly.
