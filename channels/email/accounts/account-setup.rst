Account Setup
=============

Setting up a new email account? Here's what all the settings do.

‚ò†Ô∏è **But first, a word of warning!**
The import process does things you might not expect:

   .. _email-experts-import-as-warning:

.. danger::

   * By default, Zammad will **delete all emails** in your inbox
     during the import process. Use the *Experts* dialog to
     :ref:`disable this behavior <email-experts-keep-messages-on-server>`.
   * Zammad will **send an auto-reply message to every email it imports**
     (including the old ones!). Use the *Experts* dialog to
     :ref:`change this behavior <email-experts-import-as>` or to
     :doc:`disable auto-replies </manage/trigger>` prior adding an email
     account and to turn it back on once all your messages have been imported.

.. note::

   **Gmail / G Suite users:**
      To add a Google account, create a dedicated
      :doc:`Google channel </channels/google/basic-setup>`.

   **Microsoft 365 users:**
      To add a Microsoft 365 account, create a dedicated
      :doc:`Microsoft 365 channel </channels/microsoft365/accounts/account-setup>`.

Basic
-----

In most cases, Zammad is smart enough to figure out your email provider's
configuration based on your email address alone. If the correct configuration
could not be retrieved, Zammad asks you to provide the correct parameters
manually.

Organization & Department Name
   The display name used for outgoing email.

      A customer's inbox with an auto-reply from **Chrispresso Sales**.

   If you add :doc:`multiple addresses <secondary-addresses>` to a single
   account, you can define a separate Organization & Department Name for each
   one.

   Email display names value can be
   :ref:`further customized in the Settings tab <email-settings-sender-format>`.

Email
   Your email address.

   If your account login/username is different from your email address,
   use the *Experts* dialog (see below).

   If your inbox receives mail for more than one email address,
   be sure to :doc:`add your alternate addresses <secondary-addresses>`
   after account setup.

Password
   Your account password.

Destination Group
   The :doc:`group </manage/groups/index>` that incoming mail will be assigned
   to.

   Use :doc:`filters </channels/email/filters>` for more fine-grained sorting
   of incoming email.

Experts
-------

If Zammad can't figure out how to connect your account
(or if you just want to access advanced settings),
use the *Experts* dialog.

Email Inbound
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Type
   Choose from **IMAP** and **POP3**.

   In most cases, you want IMAP.
   (With POP3, you won't be able to
   :ref:`keep messages on the server <email-experts-keep-messages-on-server>`
   or :ref:`specify which folder to fetch from <email-experts-folder>`.)

Host
   Your email server's hostname or IP address (*e.g.,* ``imap.gmail.com``).

   Contact your email provider or system administrator if you don't know.

User
   This field is being pre-filled with your email address in case you've
   provided one before opening the expert settings.

   Adjust this setting in case your username and email address differ.

Password
   Your account password.

SSL / STARTTLS
   Enable encryption when fetching messages.

   You can choose from the following options:

      * No SSL (*not recommended!*)
      * SSL
      * STARTTLS

SSL verification
   Here you can decide if the certificate of the email server has to be
   verified or not (default: ``yes``). In case you are using custom
   certificates, please have a look at
   :doc:`how to add them to Zammad </settings/security/ssl-certificates>`.

   .. include:: /includes/ssl-verification-warning.rst

Port
   Your email server's port (usu. ``993`` for IMAP, or ``995`` for POP3).

   Contact your email provider or system administrator if you don't know.

   .. _email-experts-folder:

Folder
   Specify which folder to fetch from, or leave empty to fetch from ``INBOX``.

   If specifying a nested folder, be sure to use the full path.
   (Some systems use different **path separators**;
   *e.g.,* ``Inquiries/Tech-Support`` vs. ``Inquiries.Tech-Support``.
   Contact your email provider or system administrator if you don't know.)

   If you selected a folder, additional steps may be required:
   In the last step of the account setup process,
   Zammad sends you an email from your own account,
   then waits for it to appear in the folder specified here.
   **Account verification will not complete until
   this test message has been received.**

   If this folder does not receive incoming messages automatically,
   you may have to manually check your inbox during the verification step
   and move Zammad's test message there when it arrives.

   .. _email-experts-keep-messages-on-server:

Keep messages on server
   Specify what happens to your emails after Zammad imports them:

   * ``no``: Zammad deletes all imported messages

   * ``yes``: Zammad marks imported messages as read. With this option, Zammad
     will only import unread messages. This means Zammad may miss messages if
     the mailbox is externally modified.


   .. note:: ü§î **Why does Zammad delete messages by default?**

      If you never clean out your inbox,
      it'll eventually reach its storage limit,
      and your mail server will start **rejecting incoming messages**.
      Most Zammad users never even look at their inbox once it's set up,
      so they rely on Zammad to keep it clean for them.

      If you choose **yes** here, remember that it's your responsibility
      to clean out your inbox from time to time
      to keep it below its storage limit.

   .. _email-experts-import-as:

Import as

      :alt: ‚ÄúImport as‚Äù option in email account setup dialog
      :align: center
      :width: 40%

      How should old emails be imported?

   During the import process, Zammad treats **all messages**
   (including ones you've already read from months or years ago)
   as if they had been sent today:
   senders will receive auto-replies and tickets are created with state "new"
   for each message.

   Use this option to disable this behavior for messages more than two weeks
   old.

   .. note:: This option may not be shown if:

      * all messages in your inbox are less than two weeks old
      * you selected **Keep messages on server: Yes**
      * you selected **Type: POP3**

      For more fine-grained control,
      manually disable this and other :doc:`triggers </manage/trigger>`
      before adding an email account,
      then turn them back on once all your messages have been imported.

Email Outbound

   Configuration dialog of email channel outbound

Send mails via
   Choose from **SMTP** and **local MTA** (*e.g.,* Sendmail).

   Local MTA (mail transfer agent) configuration
   is only available on self-hosted installations.

Host
   Your email server's hostname or IP address (*e.g.,* ``smtp.gmail.com``).

User
   Your account login/username.

   Leave blank to use the same value from incoming account setup.

Password
   Your account password.

   Leave blank to use the same value from incoming account setup.

Port
   Your email server's port (usu. ``587`` or ``465``).

   Zammad will detect and enable SSL/STARTTLS support automatically.

SSL verification
   Here you can decide if the certificate of the email server has to be
   verified or not (default: ``yes``). In case you are using custom
   certificates, please have a look at
   :doc:`how to add them to Zammad </settings/security/ssl-certificates>`.

   .. include:: /includes/ssl-verification-warning.rst


Verification
------------

.. figure:: /images/channels/email/adding-email-account_verification-send-and-receive.gif
   :alt: Email account verification step
   :align: center

As a final step, Zammad sends a test email from your own account,
to your own account, and to ``verify-external-smtp-sending@discard.zammad.org``
which discards the test mail right away.

We've created a
`landing page for discard.zammad.org <https://discard.zammad.org>`_
which describes the backgrounds as well.


This this Zammad ensures that your email account is capable of sending internal
and external - once this is verified the setup process is complete! üéâ
