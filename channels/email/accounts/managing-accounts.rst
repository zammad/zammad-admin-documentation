   Use the **+ Add** or **Edit** buttons
   to set up secondary addresses on this account.

Enabled / Disabled
   Disabling an account temporarily prevents Zammad from importing its messages.

   This may be necessary during scheduled maintenance
   or when migrating your installation to a new host. 

   .. note:: 📮 Disabling an account disables *outgoing* messages for it, as well.

Delete
   Deleting an account removes its configuration from Zammad entirely.

   .. note:: 🧹 **Additional Steps Required**

      When an email account is deleted,
      its :doc:`email aliases <secondary-addresses>` **remain in the system**. 
      Be sure to reassign or delete them manually.

         Click on the address to assign it to another account, or click ✖ to delete it.

      Groups need an assigned an address to send outgoing emails.
      If you delete a group’s assigned address,
      agents belonging to that group won’t be able to send emails
      until you assign it a new one.
