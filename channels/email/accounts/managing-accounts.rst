   Only **active** groups will be displayed.

   Changing this setting will not reassign existing tickets to the new group.

Mail Server Settings

Enabled / Disabled
   Disabling an account temporarily prevents Zammad from importing its messages.

   This may be necessary during scheduled maintenance
   or when migrating your installation to a new host. 

   .. note:: 📮 Disabling an account disables *outgoing* messages for it, as well.

Delete
   Deleting an account removes its configuration from Zammad entirely.
