Managing Accounts
=================

Once an account has been added, use the Accounts panel to edit its configuration.

Destination Group
   Click on the group name to reassign the account.

   Only **active** groups will be displayed.

   Changing this setting will not reassign existing tickets to the new group.

   .. hint:: ðŸ“® **Still canâ€™t send outgoing email tickets?**
      Check your :doc:`group settings </manage/groups>`.

Email Address
   Use the **+ Add** or **Edit** buttons
   to set up secondary addresses on this account.

   See :doc:`secondary-addresses` for a detailed description of each option.

Enabled / Disabled
   Disabling an account temporarily prevents Zammad from importing its messages.

   This may be necessary during scheduled maintenance
   or when migrating your installation to a new host. 

   .. note:: ðŸ“® Disabling an account disables *outgoing* messages for it, as well.

Delete
   Deleting an account removes its configuration from Zammad entirely.

   .. include:: managing-accounts.delete-note.rst
