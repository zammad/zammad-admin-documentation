Email Notification
==================

.. note:: The notification channel can only be configured
   on **self-hosted installations**.

   For more information, see :doc:`/manage/trigger/system-notifications`.

System notifications are automated emails
sent by Zammad for critical system events,
such as account changes or SLA violations.

Use the **Email Notification** panel to configure
how Zammad dispatches these notifications.
