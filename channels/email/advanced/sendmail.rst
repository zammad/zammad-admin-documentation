Dispatch Messages With Sendmail
*******************************

.. warning::

   For the initial setup of this you need administrative rights on the
   Zammad machine (console).

If you try to configure **only** an outgoing email account
(as in, you do not wish to set up an incoming IMAP/POP3 account at all),
you will find that itâ€™s simply not possible via the email channel setup wizard.
Instead, you will have to create it via the CLI.

(The wizard is designed to provide an idiot-proof email configuration process
for the average, non-technical user,
so certain advanced options and use cases have been deliberately omitted.)

To configure Zammad to use sendmail, run the following command
(you can use rails r [...] if you installed Zammad from source)::

   zammad run rails r "Channel.create(area: 'Email::Account', options: { inbound: { adapter: 'null', options: {} }, outbound: { adapter: 'sendmail' } }, active: true, preferences: { editable: false }, updated_by_id: 1, created_by_id: 1)"

Now, you should see a new **Email Account** entry in the admin settings panel:

.. figure:: /images/channels/zammad_email_sendmail.png
   :alt: The new, outbound-only email channel appears in the admin settings
         email panel.

   Use the **Add** button under the **Email Address** heading to add new email
   addresses to send from.
