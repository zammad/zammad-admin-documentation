System Filters
**************

On this page you can find some pre-defined filters that you won't find within
the Zammad's UI. Those filters might come in handy when trying to understand
Zammad's behavior.

.. note::

   Please note that this is not a full filters list, if you're missing filters,
   feel free to ask over at the `Community <https://community.zammad.org>`_.
