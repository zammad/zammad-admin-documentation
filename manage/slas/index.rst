SLAs
====

Service Level Agreements, abbreviated SLAs, help you to meet specific response
times for your customers' requests. This way you can define goals such as
answering every inquiry within eight hours. If you are at risk of missing this
target, Zammad will alert you.

Agents will be notified via several, optional ways. You can provide overviews
for escalated or soon to escalate tickets to help you agents. Also, agents can
check the current applying SLA timings of tickets at any time.

Online notifications
   Zammad will warn agents roughly 15 minute before escalation and when the
   ticket finally escalates. This depends on the notification configuration of
   your agent.

Email notifications
   Zammad will warn agents roughly 15 minute before escalation and when the
   ticket finally escalates. This depends on the notification configuration of
   your agent.

Overviews
   You can configure :doc:`/manage/overviews` to allow your agents to filter
   for escalated tickets or those that are about to escalate. By default Zammad
   comes with an overview that will show all tickets that are either escalated
   or escalating within the next 10 minutes: ``Escalated Tickets``.

   .. tip::

      If you have all/most of your tickets covered by SLAs you may consider
      changing the default sorting of existing overviews by escalation time,
      instead of creation time.

SLA timings of a ticket
   Ticket zooms provide a timestamp of the next escalation of a ticket. Agents
   can hover that timestamp and learn about all upcoming escalation stages.
