Organizations
*************

Organizations allow you to group customers. This has two important advantages,
among other things.

1.) As an agent you not only have the overview of a customer's tickets, but also
an overview of the entire organization.

For example, by searching for the organization, all the tickets for the
organization are displayed and they can be opened easily by a click.
This overview appears as follows:

2.) As a customer, you can view and edit your colleagues' tickets
(if the organization is a "shared organization", you can set this as a parameter
for each organization. See the Edit-Mask).

**For example:**
   For a customer user who has only created one ticket himself, but whose entire
   organization has created 6, the overview would look like this:

In the organizations management area
(Admin Interface --> Manage --> Organizations) you can manually add, edit or
delete existing organizations. That's the Edit-Mask:

Within the organization the following things can be set:

- if it's a shared organization (All customers who are assigned to this
  organization can view and edit the group tickets)
- if the assignment is domain based (assign users based on domain)
- note
- if it's active or inactive


Import of organizations via CSV file
------------------------------------

With the import action (since Zammad 2.5) you can download a sample CSV file
and upload your own CSV file.

To reduce the error rate of unwanted mass changes, a test import is carried out
first and a summary appears at the end. If you agree with the summary, the CSV
import will be executed.
