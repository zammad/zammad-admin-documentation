Tags
====

With tags, tickets can be categorized and marked.

How to Tag
----------

All agents can tag tickets. You can find further information about tagging of
tickets on our
:user-docs:`user documentation </basics/service-ticket/settings/tags.html>`.
If you don't want your agents to create new tags, disable the creation of new
tags by setting the toggle to inactive.

Tag-Overviews
-------------

You can find tickets based on their tags in different ways:

By providing an appropriate overview
   Create a new overview and select "Tag contains ..." as condition.
   You can find further information in :doc:`overviews`.

By a search-query
   Enter e.g.: ``tags:americano`` in the search and you will get all
   tickets that have been tagged accordingly.

By clicking on the tag in the tag management
   In the tag management you can find an overview of existing tags used in the
   system (and a counter how often they are used):

   For more information about the individual tags, just click on the blue
   counter. This creates a search for this tag. Select one of the tickets that
   appears below the search box or get a complete overview of all tickets by
   clicking on "Show Search Details"
