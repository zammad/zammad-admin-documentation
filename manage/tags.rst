With tags, tickets can be categorized and marked.

How to tag
----------

All agents can tag tickets. You can find further information about tagging of
tickets on our `user documentation`_.

.. _user documentation:
   https://user-docs.zammad.org/en/latest/basics/service-ticket/settings/tags.html

Tag-Overviews
-------------

You can list all the marked tickets by tag in different ways:

1. by providing an appropriate overview
   Create a new overview and select "Tag contains ..." as condition.
   You can find further information in :doc:`overviews`

2. by a search-query
   Enter e. g.: ``tags:americano`` in the search mask and you will receive all
   tickets that have been tagged accordingly. For a collected listing, click on
   "Show Search Details" under the search box:

   .. figure:: /images/manage/tags/searching-for-tags.png

3. by clicking on the tag in the Tag Management Area
   In the Tag Management you can find an overview of existing tags used in the
   system (and a counter how often they are used):

   For more information about the individual tags, just click on the blue
   counter:

   .. figure:: /images/manage/tags/search-for-tag-via-tag-management.gif

   Select one of the tickets that appears below the search box or get a complete
   overview of all tickets by clicking on "Show Search Details":

Tag Management Area
-------------------

Here it can also (in addition to the overview - as described above) be set
whether the agents are allowed to add tags themselves or not
(in the left upper corner).

You can add more tags or delete them.
