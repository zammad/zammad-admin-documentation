How Do Macros Work
==================

Macros are made up of **actions** (changes to a ticket).
You can add as many actions to a macro as you want.

There are also a few other settings that affect who can use a macro or how it
behaves.

Creating Macros

:Actions:
   You can create actions to:

   * set ticket attributes (priority, state, group, etc.)
   * add new notes to a ticket

   There are **no** actions for:

   * sending a reply to the customer

   .. note:: Unlike triggers, the scheduler, and text modules,
      macro actions do **not** support the use of
      :doc:`/misc/variables`.

   .. warning:: If the ticket is missing a required attribute
      and the macro doesn't set it, then **no actions will be
      applied**.

:Once completed...:
   After running this macro, should Zammad remain on the current
   tab, close it, or automatically switch to the next ticket?
   (Does not apply when running macros "in bulk".)

:Note:
   What should other Zammad admins know about this macro?
   (Visible only via the "Edit: Macro" dialog, Rails console, and API.)

:Groups:
   Which :doc:`/manage/groups/index` are allowed to see/use this macro?

:Active:
   Choose "inactive" to disable this macro without deleting it.

Managing Macros
---------------

Edit your macros by simply clicking on it. You can delete or even clone
existing macros by clicking on the ï¸™ action menu and select the desired action:

When cloning a macro, make sure to click "Submit" for the duplicate to be
created.
