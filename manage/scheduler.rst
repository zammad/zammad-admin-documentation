Scheduler
*********

The scheduler performs time-based automated actions. You can set up your own
schedulers, configure at which points in time they should run, set up conditions
to determine which objects they should affect, and then configure the actions
that you want to be executed on these objects.

.. Setting warning box to inactive, because it is missing e.g. in triggers /RSC
.. .. warning::

..    While it is possible to delegate scheduler permissions to normal agents with
..    the ``admin.scheduler`` permission, it is inadvisable to do so. Malicious
..    agents could use a scheduler to access tickets in restricted groups
..    (by moving them to a non-restricted group) or to arbitrarily delete tickets.

.. hint::

   Schedulers can be used to send periodic reminder emails.
   Use :doc:`/system/variables` to build highly-customized email templates.

   Schedulers only perform ``2000`` objects per run. This is a security
   function in case you accidentally misconfigured the scheduler.

Add a new scheduler
===================

Create a new scheduler job by clicking on the "New scheduler" button in the top
right corner. Then Zammad presents a dialog where you can create your own one.

Example:

.. figure:: /images/manage/scheduler/scheduler-change-owner-in-case-of-ticket-escalation.png
   :alt: Screenshot showing dialog of creating a new scheduler job
   :scale: 70%
   :align: center

Name
   Choose a name for the scheduler.

When should the job run?
   Choose the points in time when the scheduler should run. It depends on the
   configured :doc:`timezone in Zammad </settings/branding>`.

Object
   Choose in which object context the scheduler should be executed. Possible
   objects are: **Organization**, **Ticket** and **User**.

Conditions for affected objects
   Determine the object attributes (conditions) to limit on which objects the
   actions configured in step 5 are to be performed.

   .. include:: /misc/object-conditions/conditioning-depth-hint.include.rst

Preview
   This list previews some objects that your conditions are matching and shows
   a total of how many objects are being matched. Use this to double-check the
   entered conditions.

   Please be aware that the preview and displayed number is just based on
   the currently selected condition. It doesn't necessarily represent the
   objects for execution at the defined time.

Execute changes on objects
   Determine the changes to be made to the object. The possible changes depend
   on the selected object context.

   .. warning::

      ðŸ”¥ Schedulers with *Action: Delete immediately* and *Action: Add a data
      privacy deletion task* are dangerous and should be used with care! If
      executed, the objects are deleted and no rollback is possible.

      **Delete immediately** will delete the ticket at the runtime of the job
      *without any hint* in the UI.

      **Add a data privacy deletion task** will create a data privacy deletion
      task for the object at the runtime of the job. That means it is visible
      in Zammad's :doc:`data privacy panel </system/data-privacy>`.

Disable notifications
   By default, actions triggered by schedulers won't send notifications.
   You can override this here by setting this to *no*.

Note
   You can use the note field to describe the purpose of the scheduler.
   This is only visible to other admins when they are editing the scheduler.
   It is *not* a way to add notes to objects.

Active
   With this setting you can enable/disable the scheduler.

The scheduler shown in the screenshot would have the following effects:

   Every workday (Monday to Friday) at 9:00 a.m. (*Europe / Berlin UTC+1*),
   all tickets which:

      - are not closed or merged, and
      - are assigned to the Sales group, and
      - whose escalation was 30 minutes ago

   will be:

      - assigned to Emma, and
      - have their priority changed to 3 high.

   As a supervisor in the Sales group, this enables Emma to intercept and
   process escalated tickets.

   Emma will not receive notifications when the scheduler assigns her these
   tickets.
