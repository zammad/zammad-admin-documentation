Managing Users via the Admin Panel
==================================

The “Users” panel provides tools to manually manage user accounts. See
:ref:`user-details-reference` for help with the New/Edit User dialog.

👥 Creating and editing users
   .. figure:: /images/manage/users/user-management.png

   Click the **New User** button to open the New User dialog,
   or click on an existing user to edit.

🗑️ Deleting users
   .. figure:: /images/manage/users/action-menu-delete-user.png
      :alt: Screenshot shows user deletion via action menu.
      :align: center

   Use the ⋮ **Actions** menu to open the **Delete User** dialog.

   .. warning:: 💥 **Deleting a customer destroys all their associated tickets!**

      To learn more, see :doc:`/system/data-privacy`.

🔎 Filtering the user list
   .. figure:: /images/manage/users/search-and-roles.png
      :alt: Screenshot shows selected role and search term in user management.
      :align: center

   Use the 🔎 **Search for users** bar and the **Roles** buttons to filter the list.
   You may search by name, email, or any other user attribute.

   .. _locked-user-accounts:

🔒 Unlock locked user accounts
   .. figure:: /images/manage/users/unlock-user.png
      :alt: Screenshot shows locked user indicator and context menu to unlock the account.
      :align: center

   Use the ⋮ **Actions** menu to unlock accounts after too many
   failed logins. Locked accounts are indicated with a 🔒 lock icon
   on the left side.

   .. _view-from-users-perspective:

🏴‍☠️ Taking over a user's session
   .. figure:: /images/manage/users/action-menu-view-from-user.png
      :alt: Screenshot shows menu with "View from user's perspective" option.
      :align: center

   Use the ⋮ **Actions** menu to 👁️ **View from user's perspective**.

   The **View from user's perspective** button
   allows you to “hijack” another user's session
   and confirm firsthand what they can and can't do (or see)
   when they're logged in.

   This is especially useful when you need to verify
   that you've set up custom permissions correctly for non-admin users.

   When finished, use the **Back to my view ✕** button at the top of the page.
   If you try to exit by logging out,
   the "hijacked" user session will be restored when you log back in.

   .. danger:: **⚠ With great power comes with great responsibility.**

      This feature is not a simulation;
      entering this mode will boot the user from their session,
      and any actions you take
      (responding to tickets, changing passwords,
      :doc:`logging hours worked </manage/time-accounting>`)
      will actually be performed from the user's account.

      (On the other hand, if the user logs back in, you'll be booted, too.)

🔑 Manage Two-Factor Authentication
   .. figure:: /images/manage/users/manage-2fa-of-user.png
      :alt: Screenshot shows menu with highlighted "Manage Two-Factor Authentication" option.
      :align: center

   Use the ⋮ **Actions** menu to remove a user's configured two-factor
   method.

   .. figure:: /images/manage/users/dialog-2fa-deletion.png
      :alt: Screenshot shows dialog to delete a user's 2FA method.
      :align: center

   It's possible to remove a single or all of the user's configured methods, if
   they lose access. They can then set it up again by themselves via
   *Avatar > Profile > Password & Authentication*.
