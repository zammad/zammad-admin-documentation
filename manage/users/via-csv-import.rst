Managing Users via CSV Import
=============================

If your organization has information about customers (or personnel)
already stored in a directory system that can export to CSV,
you can batch-import them into Zammad in just three steps.

For persistent, automated user synchronization,
consider integration with a third-party directory system
like :doc:`LDAP / Active Directory </system/integrations/ldap/index>`
or :doc:`Exchange </system/integrations/exchange>`.

   Use the **Import** button to open the CSV import dialog.

Step 1: Inspect the Sample .csv
-------------------------------

Use the link at the bottom of the CSV import dialog
(**‚ÄúExample CSV file for download‚Äù**)
to see how Zammad expects you to format your user data.

Step 2: Export Your User Data to .csv
-------------------------------------

Prepare your .csv file according to the format found in Step 1 above. Note that:

* the ``id`` attribute (column) should be left blank or removed entirely;
* the ``firstname`` and ``lastname`` attributes are **required**; and
* any other columns may be safely omitted
  as long as each row has the same number of fields (commas).

For instance:

.. code-block:: none

   login,firstname,lastname,email,web,active,roles
   jdoe,John,Doe,jdoe@example.com,https://zammad.com,true,admin~~~agent
   mmore,Madeline,Moore,mmore@example.net,"",false,customer

If you have more than one value for a field, separate them with ``~~~`` as
above.

Step 3: Import Your .csv to Zammad
----------------------------------

Once your raw user data has been submitted,
Zammad will perform a test run to compute the number of affected records:

.. figure:: /images/manage/users/import-summary-before-importing.png
   :alt: CSV import test run and confirmation dialog
   :align: center
   :width: 90%

   CSV import always begins with a preview / test run.

.. note:: ü§î **How does it know when to create new records and when to update?**

   Records are updated when the imported data contains an ``email`` or ``login``
   that matches an existing user account.

Click **Yes, start real import** to proceed.
(If you're importing a lot of records, be patient - it may take a minute.)

That's it! üéâüéâüéâ
