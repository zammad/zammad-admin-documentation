Report-Profiles
***************

Report profiles are used to restrict / filter report-results. The idea of the
profiles is to limit the number of tickets and determine the type of tickets
you want to analyze. You can create any number of profiles in the Admin
Interface in the "Report Profile" area. The edit-mask looks like this:

.. figure:: /images/manage/report-profiles/profile-filtering-for-specific-organization-by-created-at-within-last-month.png

This example shows the statistics of all tickets of the organization
"Awesome Customer" that were created in the last month.

The filters can be combined with each other as desired. The filters build on
each other, which means that they are further restricted per additional
attribute.

All configured filters are displayed in the statistics area and you can switch
between them with one click:

You can filter the Create Channels (Phone, email, Twitter,...) and Communication

upper left corner - currently Ticket Count, Create Channels, Communication).
Here are  all tickets with a certain metric of a profile evaluated.
