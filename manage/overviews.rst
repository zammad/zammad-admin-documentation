Overviews
*********

You can provide overviews to your agents and customers. They can be used as a
kind of worklist of tasks that the agent is supposed to work off.
You can also create individual reports for individual agents or agent groups.

In the Overview Management Area you can add new overviews, edit or delete them.

.. warning::

   Please note that Overviews can cause performance issues leading to no longer
   or less often refreshing overviews!

   Whenever possible, try to use the same overviews for as many agents and
   groups as possible to keep the number of overviews
   low. For best results, you might want to use between 15-20 overviews maximum.
   Also, any overview will only show a total of 2100 elements.

.. note::

   Overviews will only show tickets to your users, that the user have rights on
   (group or role based).

The following attributes can be set when creating an overview:

Available for the following roles / Restrict to only the following users
   .. figure:: /images/manage/overviews/restriction-and-availability-of-overviews-for-roles-and-users.png
      :width: 80%

   .. hint::

      Roles are assigned to users, per default there are agents, admins and
      customers. Further information about :doc:`roles/index`.

   .. note:: The setting "available for the following roles" is mandatory.

   Define roles that are supposed to see and use the overview in question.

   If your overview is rather specific for a sub group of users of your role,
   use the *"Restrict to only the following users"* option to further restrict
   the visibility of the overview to defined users.

      .. hint::

         You will still have to provide a role!

Only available for users with shared organization
   .. image:: /images/manage/overviews/restrict-overview-to-sharing-organizations.png

   .. hint::

      Shared organization is a setting in the organization management.
      See :doc:`/manage/organizations/index` for more information.

   This is only important if the available role is a customer.
   When deciding whether yes or no is selected, it must be considered to what
   extent this makes sense - for example, if a customer sees only his own
   tickets, many views are usually not necessary...

   .. note:: Users also refers to the customer role in this case.

Available for users which are replacements for other users.
   .. figure:: /images/manage/overviews/restrict-overview-to-replacement-users.png

   This selection refers to the setting in the user preferences
   (profile-pic in the left corner --> profile -->) "out of office".
   If this option is checked, this selection is only displayed if someone
   has been entered as a substitution.

   **For example:** Agent A is on vacation and Agent B will take care of his
   tickets. Then an overview can be set up, which only shows Agent B all
   new tickets from Agent A for this period of time, without having to search
   for them separately.

   .. note::

      Replacement users are part of our `Out of Office function`_.

Conditions for shown tickets
   .. figure:: /images/manage/overviews/overview-conditions-for-to-be-shown-tickets.png

   What conditions should the listed tickets contain? (it is like a filter)
   You can add more than one condition. In the preview you have the possibility
   to double check if your entry of the conditions makes sense by directly
   displaying tickets that match your filtering.

Attributes
   .. figure:: /images/manage/overviews/sample-attributes-of-a-configured-overview.png

   Which attributes shall be shown in the overview? (column headers)

   With this setting you can select the headlines of your overview. Depending
   on which information is important in this selection, it can be displayed
   individually. For this example "Unassigned and open" the overview would
   look like this:

   .. figure:: /images/manage/overviews/attribute-selection-for-overviews.png

   These settings can also be adjusted individually by admins at a later time
   (In the overview, top right: Options).

   .. note::

      Please note that overview column and sort settings are global settings
      which affect all users seeing those overviews.

Sorting, Grouping and Active
   .. figure:: /images/manage/overviews/ordering-and-grouping-of-overviews.png

   :Sorting by:
      In which order should the tickets be displayed? (Sorted by the attributes)

   :Sorting order:
      The direction of the sorting.

   :Grouping by:
      Should the tickets be grouped by a specific attribute within the list?

   :Grouping order:
      The direction of the grouping.

   :Active:
      Should the overview be active or not?
      Rather than deleting an overview entirely, you can set it to inactive to
      make it unavailable to your users.

   .. note::

      Users can define their own overview order.
      Renaming or reordering overviews has no effect on custom orders!

      You can learn more about this setting in the `user documentation`_.
