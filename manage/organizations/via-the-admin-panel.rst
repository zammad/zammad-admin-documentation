New/Edit Organization dialog.

      Click the **New Organization** button to open the New Organization dialog,
      or click on an existing organization to edit.

üóëÔ∏è Deleting organizations
   Organizations currently can only be removed via data privacy by deleting
   the last organization member and then choose ``yes`` for
   *Delete organization?*.

   .. warning:: üí• **Deleting a customer destroys all their associated tickets!**

      To learn more, see :doc:`/system/data-privacy`.

   .. hint::

      Technically organization removal is possible via
      :docs:`Zammad's API </api/organization.html>`, however, this only works in
      very specific situations. You may want to stick to data privacy as of now.
