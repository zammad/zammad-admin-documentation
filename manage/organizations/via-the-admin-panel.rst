Managing Organizations via the Admin Panel
==========================================

The ‚ÄúOrganizations‚Äù panel provides tools to manually manage organization
entries. See :ref:`organization-details-reference` for help with the
New/Edit Organization dialog.

üë• Creating and editing organizations
      Click the **New Organization** button to create a new one. Simply click
      on an existing organization to edit it. You can even clone an organization
      by using the icon in the "Action" column.

üóëÔ∏è Deleting organizations
   Organizations currently can only be removed via data privacy by deleting
   the last organization member and then choose ``yes`` for
   *Delete organization?*.

      Use the ‚ãÆ **Actions** menu to open the **Delete User** dialog.

   .. warning:: üí• **Deleting a customer destroys all their associated tickets!**

      To learn more, see :doc:`/system/data-privacy`.

   .. hint::

      Technically organization removal is possible via
      :docs:`Zammad's API </api/organization.html>`, however, this only works in
      very specific situations. You may want to stick to data privacy as of now.
