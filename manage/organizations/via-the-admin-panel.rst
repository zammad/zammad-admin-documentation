Managing Organizations via the Admin Panel
==========================================

The "Organizations" panel provides tools to manually manage organization
entries. See :ref:`organization-details-reference` for help with the
New/Edit Organization dialog.

üë• Creating and editing organizations
      Click the **New Organization** button to create a new one. Simply click
      on an existing organization to edit it. You can even clone an organization
      by using the icon in the "Action" column.

üóëÔ∏è Deleting organizations
   Organizations currently can only be removed via data privacy deletion task
   by deleting the last organization member and then choose ``yes`` for
   *Delete organization?*.

   Use the ‚ãÆ **Actions** menu in the user overview to open the
   **Delete User** dialog or create a deletion task in the
   :doc:`data privacy </system/data-privacy>` section directly.
