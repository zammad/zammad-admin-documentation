Organizations
=============

Organizations can be managed individually via UI, via CSV import or the API.

Organizations can be managed by admins. However, in most cases agents can, too
(using the :user-docs:`ticket pane </extras/organizations.html>` or
organization detail page).

   The simplest way to manage organizations is directly in the organization
   detail view.

   via the Admin Panel <via-the-admin-panel>
   via CSV import <via-csv-import>
   via REST API <https://docs.zammad.org/en/latest/api/intro.html>

**There are some technical limitations:**

* Organizations currently cannot be removed. The only exception
  is Zammad's :doc:`/system/data-privacy` function.
* Unlike users, agents cannot just create new organizations.
  Check the :doc:`permission reference </manage/roles/admin-permissions>`
  to learn more.
* Because of how organization references work with users, external syncs
  like LDAP or Exchange *do not* support organization mapping. If this is
  relevant to you, consider domain based assignments.
* BIG organizations can cause *performance issues*. Especially organizations
  with many members can cause a fairly high system load if their members run
  many updates, for example ticket creations or frequent communication.

Reference Guide: Organization Details
-------------------------------------

Most of the attributes you can set on organizations are self-explanatory.
The ones that aren't are described below.

.. figure:: /images/manage/organizations/administrative-changing-organization-settings.png

   User details can be set in the **New/Edit Organization** dialog.

üì¢ Shared Organization
   If you set this option to ``yes``, all organization members will be able
   to **view** and **update** tickets of their organizational members in
   addition to their own.

   .. danger::

      This can cause serious issues if you have e.g. human resources working
      in the same Zammad instance. Shared organizations usually are relevant
      for Support companies with fairly big customers and support contingents.

   Setting this option to yes also provides access to overviews being
   available to shared organizations only. Learn more on
   :doc:`/manage/overviews`.

   The default value on creation dialogues is ``yes``.

   If you want to provide ticket access to agents, please see the
   :ref:`permission-guide`.

      Members of shared organization have access to organization based overviews

üóÑÔ∏è Domain based assignment
   Activating domain based assignment will cause Zammad to automatically add
   *newly created* users to said organization. This can greatly reduce your
   maintenance effort and is seen as workaround for not being able to map
   organizations via LDAP.

   The default value on creation dialogues is ``no``

üåê Domain
   Add the email domain of the organization with this option. It's being used
   on user creation to determine the assignment. This option belongs to
   domain based assignment and is required if set to ``yes``.

   Currently, Zammad allows *one* domain per organization. You may also want
   to ensure to not use free mailer domains like ``gmail.com`` for these
   assignments.

üëë VIP
   This flag is a way for your team to indicate high-status organizations. Just
   as with customers, you can set up special :doc:`/manage/trigger`,
   :doc:`/manage/scheduler` jobs, :doc:`/manage/slas/index`,
   and :doc:`/manage/overviews` just for VIPs.

      VIP organizations are displayed with a crown above their avatars.

üìë Note
   Notes are visible to all staff members, **including agents**.

   .. hint:: üòµ **Are you using the Note field
      to keep track of your own "custom" organization attributes?**

      Wish you could add your own fields to organizations?

      You can! To learn more, see :doc:`/system/objects`.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Active
   Disabling this flag is a soft alternative to deleting an organization.
   So what's the difference?

   1. There is no way to restore a deleted organization;
      inactive organizations can be reactivated at any time.

   2. Inactive organizations still appear in search results:

      .. figure:: /images/manage/organizations/search-results-showing-organizations.png
         :alt: An inactive organization displayed in a quick search list
         :align: center

         A slashed-out üè¢ icon indicates an inactive organization.
         In other cases, inactive organizations are grayed out.
