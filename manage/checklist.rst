Remarks
-------

- It is only possible to add one checklist per ticket.
- There is no specific permission for the checklist feature. You can turn it off
  or on and provide optionally usable checklist templates.
- If an agent only has reading permissions for this ticket, the checklist will
  be displayed in read-only mode.
- An agent can always overwrite and adjust the checklist, it can even be
  deleted from the ticket. This applies also to checklists which are
  added in a ticket based on a checklist template.
