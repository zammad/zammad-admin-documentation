                            .. tip::

                               Zammad supports `granular permissions on knowledge base categories`_.

                               This function allows *agents with editor* permissions to restrict
                               specific internal categories & answers to chosen roles.

                               In order to allow your agents to set granular role permissions,
                               the roles in question require at least reader permission for the
                               knowledge base.

                                 .. danger::

                                    Keep in mind that this may be dangerous, as reader permission
                                    provides access to internal answers!

                            .. warning:: 🙅 **Never grant this permission to your customers.**

                               Giving customers access to reporting constitutes a serious data breach,
                               as it includes **all ticket and user information across the entire system**!

                            .. note:: This permission is the exception to the rule on this page:

                               1. the feature it enables is not for communicating with customers;
                               2. the button appears at the *bottom* of the sidebar; and
                               3. it is typically reserved for admins and supervisors.

                            .. note:: 🤔 **What’s this big table doing here in the middle of my permissions?**

                                  The group access table is shown
                                  when there is **more than one active group** in the system.

                               Okay, so remember when we said that :ref:`“roles are just collections of permissions” <what-is-a-role>`?
                               That wasn’t *entirely* true—they can also be collections of **group access levels**.

                               To learn more, see :doc:`/manage/groups/access-levels`.

                            .. hint:: 🤓 **Point of technicality**

                               As of Zammad 3.5, you can assign both agent and customer roles to the same user—but
                               but you **can’t** assign both ``ticket.agent`` and ``ticket.customer`` *permissions* to the same *role!*

                               To make it work, you need two separate roles:
                               one with ``ticket.agent`` and the other with ``ticket.customer``.
