User Preferences Permissions
============================

.. note::

   üìÅ **Permissions are namespaced**,
   which is sort of like having files inside of folders.

   The permissions listed on this page all belong to the
   ``user_preferences`` namespace.
   You can select them individually, or you can just select
   ``user_preferences`` to enable the whole bunch.
