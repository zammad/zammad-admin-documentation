Macros
======

Macros are **üñ±Ô∏è one-click actions** for applying changes to a ticket.

If you find yourself making the same changes to lots of tickets
(*e.g.,* close-and-tag-as-spam or reassign-to-another-group),
you can store those changes in a macro for easy access:

   :alt: Example macros within a ticket detail view.

   Choose from the macros **Close & Tag as Spam**, **Move to RMA**,
   and **Reply & Close & Tag as Banana**.

You can also apply macros in bulk (*i.e.,* to many tickets all at once)
via the *Overviews* page:

   Select your desired tickets, then click-and-drag
   to apply a macro to all of them.

You can create or edit macros on the Macros page of the admin panel:
