Microsoft Teams Notifications
=============================

.. warning::

   Microsoft decided to retire
   `their Office 365 connectors <https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/retirement-of-office-365-connectors-within-microsoft-teams/>`_.
   The new way of connecting Microsoft Teams with third-party tools is via
   `Workflows in Teams <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/browse-and-add-workflows-in-microsoft-teams-4998095c-8b72-4b0e-984c-f2ad39e6ba9a>`_.

   In the transitional period, we decided to keep this guide as is. Make sure
   to follow Microsoft's guide as a replacement for **step 1** below, to
   connect Teams and Zammad via Workflows.

   If you already use this webhook and *didn't customize* the payload, the new
   webhook is used automatically after updating Zammad. In this case, you just
   need to create the workflow for your channel in Microsoft Teams. Otherwise
   you have to manually adjust the payload in Zammad, too. See
   :doc:`Microsoft Teams Payload </manage/webhook/examples/microsoft-teams-payload>`
   where you can find the old and new defaults in case you need it.

   To manage the connection in Zammad, you can go on with **step 2** on this
   page.

Follow the steps below to configure a webhook for receiving Zammad notifications
in a Microsoft Teams channel.

Step 1 - Setup Incoming Webhook Connector in your Teams Channel
---------------------------------------------------------------

In your target Teams Channel, click on the overflow menu in the upper right
corner and choose **Connectors**.

Find a connector named **Incoming Webhook** in the list and click on
**Configure** button next to it.

Provide an appropriate name for the incoming webhook connector, keeping in mind
this will be used as the name for all of the notification messages in the
channel.

Optionally, provide a custom image which will be used as the avatar.

Click on **Create** and be patient.

Once created, make sure to copy *the webhook endpoint URL* to clipboard and save
it for later. You can do this in one click via the button shown right next to
the field.

Finally, close the connector configuration by clicking **Done**.

Step 2 - Add a Pre-defined Webhook in Zammad
--------------------------------------------

Go to :doc:`Webhook </manage/webhook/add>` management screen in your Zammad
instance and click on the arrow next to the green button in the upper right
corner. Choose **Pre-defined Webhook** from the dropdown menu.

In the subsequent modal dialog, select **Microsoft Teams Notifications** as the
pre-defined webhook.

Click **Next**.

In the new dialog, paste *the webhook endpoint URL* from Microsoft Teams into
**Endpoint** field.

Finally, click on **Submit**.

Step 3 - Configuring a Trigger for firing of the Webhook
--------------------------------------------------------

As a last step, you need to create a
:doc:`Trigger <generic-notifications-trigger>` for posting a notification to the
Microsoft Teams channel under certain conditions.

Once the trigger is in place, your webhook is ready for use!

Sample Teams Channel Notification
---------------------------------

From now on, whenever a ticket is created or updated in your Zammad system, a
suitable notification will be posted in the configured Teams Channel. The
notification will contain the link to the ticket, updated data and
:ref:`content of the last article <teams-removing-article-body>`. It will also
also be
:user-docs:`color coded </basics/service-ticket/settings/state.html#state-colors>`
according to its latest state.

.. _teams-removing-article-body:

Removing Article Content from the Teams Notification
----------------------------------------------------

If you are concerned about leaking sensitive article content via notifications,
there is a way to remove them by further customizing the webhook payload.

Find your webhook in the list on the management screen and click on it to edit
it.

Switch on **Custom Payload** and the code editor below will be shown,
pre-populated with the default payload.

Next, identify ``{ "text": "#{notification.body}" }`` block in the JSON
structure and select it. Be sure to include the comma (``,``) in the preceding
line, since the new payload must remain a valid JSON value.

   :align: center
   :width: 80%

Then, simply delete the selected code block.

.. figure:: /images/manage/webhook/webhook-teams-custom-payload-wo-article-content.png

   :align: center
   :width: 80%

Finally, click on **Submit** to save your webhook changes.

On the next invocation of the webhook, the notification will not include content
of the last article.
