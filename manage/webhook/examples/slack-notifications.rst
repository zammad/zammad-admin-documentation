Slack Notifications
===================

Follow the steps below to configure a webhook for receiving Zammad notifications
in a Slack channel.

Step 1 - Setup Incoming WebHooks App in your Slack Channel
----------------------------------------------------------

In your target Slack Channel, click on the channel name in the upper left part
of the screen to get to channel details.

On the next screen, search for an app called *Incoming WebHooks* and click on
**Install** button next to it.

You will be redirected to the Slack App Directory website, where you can add the
app.

Click on **Add to Slack** button.

In the final screen, scroll down to **Integration Settings**.

Make sure to copy **Webhook URL** to clipboard and save it for later. You can
do this in one click via the **Copy URL** link shown right below the field.

You can also fill **Customize Name** field with an appropriate username for the
incoming webhooks integration, as this will be used for all of the notification
messages in the channel.

Optionally, you can **Customize Icon** which will be used as the avatar.

Finally, save your app configuration by clicking **Save Settings**.

Step 2 - Add a Pre-defined Webhook in Zammad
--------------------------------------------

Go to :doc:`Webhook </manage/webhook/add>` management screen in your Zammad
instance and click on the arrow next to the green button in the upper right
corner. Choose **Pre-defined Webhook** from the dropdown menu.

In the subsequent modal dialog, select **Slack Notifications** as the
pre-defined webhook.

field.

Finally, click on **Submit**.

Step 3 - Configuring a Trigger for firing of the Webhook
--------------------------------------------------------

As a last step, you need to create a
:doc:`Trigger <generic-notifications-trigger>` for posting a notification to the
Slack channel under certain conditions.

Once the trigger is in place, your webhook is ready for use!

Sample Slack Channel Notification
---------------------------------

From now on, whenever a ticket is escalated or has reached escalation warning in
your Zammad system, a suitable notification will be posted in the configured
Slack Channel. The notification will contain the link to the ticket, escalation
information and
:ref:`content of the last article <slack-removing-article-body>`.
It will also be `color coded`_ according to its latest state.

Removing Article Content from the Slack Notification
----------------------------------------------------

If you are concerned about leaking sensitive article content via notifications,
there is a way to remove them by further customizing the webhook payload.

Find your webhook in the list on the management screen and click on it to edit
it.

Switch on **Custom Payload** and the code editor below will be shown,
pre-populated with the default payload.

Next, identify the line starting with ``"text": "...`` block in the JSON
structure.

.. figure:: /images/manage/webhook/webhook-slack-custom-payload.png

Scroll horizontally to the end of the line and select
``\n\n#{notification.body}`` part near the end. Be sure not to include the end
double quote with comma (``",``) in the rest of the line, since the new payload
must remain a valid JSON value.

Then, simply delete the selected code.

Finally, click on **Submit** to save your webhook changes.

On the next invocation of the webhook, the notification will not include content
of the last article.
