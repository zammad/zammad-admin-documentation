Groups
======

This is the group management area. From here you can edit existing groups and
add new groups.

Groups in Zammad are similar to working groups that deal with different topics
within a company. For example, the tickets relevant to the sales department
might be available in the *Sales* group, while the tickets for the support
department might be available in the *Support* group. These are just examples;
how you structure your groups is up to you.

Tickets enter Zammad through various channels (e.g. via email) and are then
sorted into these groups. The tickets (cases) are thus made available to the
agents responsible for the group. Each ticket can only belong to one group,
and you can decide via **access levels** (see below) what access your agents
have in each group. For example, you might want set up a group *Management* for
confidential tickets; with access levels, you can configure that only a few
select agents will have access to these tickets.

For an additional way to categorize tickets, have a look at :doc:`/manage/tags`.

   Zammad users are global to the whole instance. 
   Restriction to specific groups is not possible.

.. hint:: If the *Group* field does not appear in the ticket view, ensure that:

   * you have created more than one group
   * the current user has "change" permissions to more than one group

   This is necessary because Zammad automatically hides selection fields with
   only one option.
