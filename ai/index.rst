Provider Configuration
----------------------

To use Zammad, you have to configure an AI provider which handles the requests.
You can configure it in Zammad's admin settings under *AI > Provider*.

The following providers are supported:

- `Ollama <#ollama>`_
- `OpenAI <#openai>`_
- `Zammad AI <#id7>`_

Click the one you want to use. This will jump directly to the corresponding
section below.

Ollama
^^^^^^

`Ollama <https://ollama.com/>`_ is an AI tool that allows you to set up your
own AI server on a machine you control. Be aware that this only makes sense if
you have a GPU in your system!

Using Ollama on an own server makes sure that your data is not transferred to
a third party.

When choosing Ollama as your AI provider, you just have to provide the IP/URL
of your instance with appended port number. After that, make sure to click
the ``Save`` button and read on in the `Features <#features>`_ section. If
you don't have an Ollama running already, their
`deployment guide <https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/linux.md>`_
is a good starting point.

Depending on the feature you want to use, make sure the right model is
available. If you just installed Ollama, you can pull and run a model by
executing:

.. code-block:: sh

    ollama run llama3.2

You can find the available models in
`Ollama's model library <https://ollama.com/library>`_ and useful information
and additional links in the
`Ollama Github repository <https://ollama.com/library>`_.

OpenAI
^^^^^^

You probably already heard about `OpenAI <https://openai.com/>`_, haven't
you? To use their service as AI backend, choose them as AI provider and add
your token.

After that, make sure to click the ``Save`` button and read on in the
`Features <#features>`_ section
