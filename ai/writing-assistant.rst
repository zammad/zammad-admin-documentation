Writing Assistant
=================

Zammad's writing assistant tools allow agents to apply AI based changes to
their text before saving or sending it. You can access the settings in Zammad's
admin section under *AI > Writing Assistant*.

Make sure to configure an :doc:`AI provider <provider>` before activating the
feature. Otherwise, a warning message will tell you to do so.

Default Tools
-------------

Zammad ships some default tools:

- Improve writing
- Fix spelling and grammar
- Expand
- Simplify

These are useful basic tools for all agents. This is why they are not
customizable and deletable. If you enable the feature by turning the
**Writing Assistant** toggle on, these default tools are available to all
agents.

Note that these built-in tools can benefit from optimizations which can be
shipped by an update of Zammad.

Add Custom Tools
----------------

You can add your own custom text tools by providing instructions for the AI
about how to check or perform changes to a given text. Use cases for such
individual text tools could be:

- Apply branch specific wording
- Apply company specific wording
- Change the mood of the text
- Reduce or eliminate subjective or uninformative parts
- Combine different instructions in one tool

Click the ``New Writing Assistant Tool`` button in the header. This opens a
dialog where you have to provide some information:

- Name:
- Limit to groups:
- ...

Manage Text Tools
-----------------

In case you already added at least one text tool, you can see a table with
all your custom text tools. You can **Clone** or **Delete** them via ï¸™ action
menu. To apply changes to an existing text tool, simply click on the row to
open the dialog, adjust it and save your changes by clicking the ``Submit``
button. To set a text tool to **inactive**, set the **Active** attribute to this
value.

Usage for Agents
----------------

If enabled, agents have access to the default tools as well as the custom tools
which are available in the group. They simply have to select the text they want
to check/change and select the writing assistant tool they want to use.
The :user-docs:`AI section in the user documentation </extras/ai-features.html>`
includes additional information.
