External Data Source
********************

We assume you already had a look on :doc:`types` where you can find
a description of the individual fields.

To reproduce this example, choose a category you want to add a custom
field, click on *New Attribute* and select *External data source field* under
*Format*.

Our example story is to fetch data from an external product database. We want
to add our products to the tickets so that the products can be searched and
chosen from a list and also create a link to the product website.

Base configuration
==================

.. figure:: /images/system/objects/eds-example-base.png
    :alt: Initial steps to configure external data source object type
    :scale: 90 %
    :align: center

**Example:**

- Name: *product*
- Display: *Product*

External data source configuration
==================================

First, enter the search URL making sure it contains ``#{search.term}`` as a
parameter:

**Example:** ``https://dummyjson.com/products/search?q=#{search.term}``

After that, head down to the preview section and enter a search input for the
external data source.

**Example:** ``mac``

Then you can find a preview of the response data below:

We recommend using the preview to have a look on the structure. There is a
top-level element called ``products``. One level below, you can find the
attributes ``id`` and ``title``.

**Search result response based on search from example:**

.. code::

   {
      "products": [
         {
            "id": 6,
            "title": "MacBook Pro",

              "https://i.dummyjson.com/data/products/22/3.jpg"
            ]
         },
         {

            "title": "Plant Hanger For Home",

            "category": "home-decoration",
            "thumbnail": "https://i.dummyjson.com/data/products/26/thumbnail.jpg",
            "images": [

              "https://i.dummyjson.com/data/products/26/thumbnail.jpg"
            ]
         }
      ],
      "total": 3,
      "skip": 0,
      "limit": 3
   }

To tell the remote system that the desired data is located below the
``products`` level, you have to put it in the field *Search result list key*.

After inserting ``products`` in the mentioned field, you get an extended preview.
You can find an additional box *Search result list* with a JSON structure.
This is the same response as before but stripped from the upper
``products`` element by the external data source.

    :scale: 70 %
    :alt: Preview of JSON response search result list

Now you need to provide the keys for the search result values and labels. As
already mentioned, we are looking for the ``id`` and the ``title`` of our
products. If you haven't already, it is now a good time to look at the preview
of the *Search result list*.

.. code::

   [
      {
         "id": 6,
         "title": "MacBook Pro",
         "description": "MacBook Pro 2021 with mini-LED display may launch between September, November",
         "price": 1749,
         "discountPercentage": 11.02,
         "rating": 4.57,
         "stock": 83,
         "brand": "Apple",
         "category": "laptops",
         "thumbnail": "https://i.dummyjson.com/data/products/6/thumbnail.png",

           "https://i.dummyjson.com/data/products/6/3.png",
           "https://i.dummyjson.com/data/products/6/4.jpg"
         ]
      },
      {
         "id": 22,
         "title": "Elbow Macaroni - 400 gm",
         "description": "Product details of Bake Parlor Big Elbow Macaroni - 400 gm",
         "price": 14,
         "discountPercentage": 15.58,
         "rating": 4.57,
         "stock": 146,
         "brand": "Bake Parlor Big",
         "category": "groceries",
         "thumbnail": "https://i.dummyjson.com/data/products/22/thumbnail.jpg",
         "images": [

           "https://i.dummyjson.com/data/products/22/3.jpg"
         ]
      },
      {
         "id": 26,
         "title": "Plant Hanger For Home",
         "description": "Boho Decor Plant Hanger For Home Wall Decoration Macrame Wall Hanging Shelf",
         "price": 41,
         "discountPercentage": 17.86,
         "rating": 4.08,
         "stock": 131,
         "brand": "Boho Decor",
         "category": "home-decoration",
         "thumbnail": "https://i.dummyjson.com/data/products/26/thumbnail.jpg",
         "images": [
           "https://i.dummyjson.com/data/products/26/1.jpg",
           "https://i.dummyjson.com/data/products/26/2.jpg",
           "https://i.dummyjson.com/data/products/26/3.jpg",
           "https://i.dummyjson.com/data/products/26/4.jpg",
           "https://i.dummyjson.com/data/products/26/5.jpg",
           "https://i.dummyjson.com/data/products/26/thumbnail.jpg"
         ]
      }
   ]

After locating our two keys, we insert them in *search result value key*
(``id``) and in *Search result label key* (``title``).

Basically, we configured the external data source already and we can see a table
in the preview section:

.. figure:: /images/system/objects/eds-example-3.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 70 %
    :alt: Preview of product table based on search term

According to our example story, now just the *Link template* is missing.

.. note:: Please note that this is an optional feature. If you don't want to
   use such links, of course you don't have to configure it.

We can add now an address where additional product information can be found.

Example: ``https://your_domain.com/q=#{ticket.product}``

In the example, the parameter means:

 - ``#{}``: "Frame" for the insertion of information
 - ``ticket``: object level, where you create your custom object
 - ``product``: name of the (custom) object

After configuring your *Link template*, there will be another column in the
preview. Hovering on the icons in the *Link* column will show you where it
forwards you.

.. figure:: /images/system/objects/eds-example-4.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 70 %
    :alt: Preview of product table based on search term

In our example, one of the links looks like: https://your_domain.com/q=6, where
the 6 is the product id.

You can find more information regarding the URL in :doc:`types`.
