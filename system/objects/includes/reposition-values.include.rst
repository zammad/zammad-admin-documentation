.. tip:: **↕️ This field type allows the positioning of its values ↔️**

   In order to re-arrange the field values, edit the field and scroll below
   the values. Make sure to tick the option "Use custom option sort".

      .. warning::

         If you do not tick this field, all manual positioning you did above
         will be lost upon saving! ☠️

   Now use ☰ to drag the values in question to the correct position.
   When you're ready, submit your changes to save the object attribute.
