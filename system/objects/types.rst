Object types
************

When adding a new object, you can choose between the following object types.

.. warning::

   You cannot change the object format / type as soon as it is applied.
   If you no longer need an object, consider disabling it instead of removing.

.. note:: **What about the translation of my objects?**

   For some object types you can decide if they should be translatable or not.
   To be precise, it works only for the selectable fields because the possible
   choices are known and limited. For the following object types, you can set
   the translatable flag:

      * *Boolean field*
      * *Single selection field*
      * *Multiple selection field*
      * *Single tree selection field*
      * *Multiple tree selection field*

   For these types, you can find an additional field *Translate field contents*:

         or HTML content (rich text).

      .. warning:: **ðŸ¥µ This field can consume a lot of visual space**

         Depending on where you use this field type, it may use a lot of visual
         space if you provide a lot of text. This may be an issue to work with.

   Default
      The here provided text will be shown within the text area field or new
      data sets.

      | You can pick the maximum length of the field.
      | The default length of this object is ``500``.

      | Change the number of rows to dislay so that you can use only the space
        you really need.

.. _link-templates:

URL fields (Link-Template)
--------------------------

.. note::

   This function is restricted to Text and Select objects only.

Link-Templates are an amazing way to dynamically generate URLs.
They allow you to integrate other systems better without having to
manually copy data from Zammad if possible.

   .. note::

      Another great way of communicating with another system may be Zammad's
      :doc:`Webhooks </manage/webhook>`.

After filling a link-template enabled field, an URL icon will appear on its
right. Clicking on the icon opens a new tab.

   .. hint::

      Even though Zammad displays the link template within object edit and
      create screens, the function is optional. It's only active if you populate
      the field.

What's the difference between URL and text fields with link template...?!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Both fields have different use cases.
Use ``text`` type text fields when ever you have a *static* url that requires
dynamic parameters. If you require a drag & drop like field that you can put in
any URL, use ``URL`` type text fields.

The difference is easier to spot when comparing the fields directly,
below screencast shows the result - the dynamic approach uses existing values
in the moment of updating to built the URL - e.g.
``https://google.com/search?q=cookies`` - while the URL approach uses the
actual URL of the field - e.g. ``https://zammad.com``.

How does this work...?!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As an example, let's say you have an object called ``amazingobject`` - you want
to open a google search directly with the input from that field.

Providing below to the link-template field allows you to do so:
``https://www.google.com/search?q=#{ticket.amazingobject}``

   .. tip::

      You can use any :doc:`Zammad variable </system/variables>` as long as
      it's available in the moment you need it.

The result will look as follows.

   The above screencast shows how the link template will perform after
   object creation.
