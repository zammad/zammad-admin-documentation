Select
   Provides a drop-down field that allows selection of one value out of several.
   This field does allow setting a default value.

   .. tip::

      Adding values can be tricky for first timers, don't forget to press
      "➕ Add" after typing your values. Otherwise you may loose a value.

   .. hint::

      Select fields allow usage of
      :ref:`URL fields (Link Templates) <link-templates>`.

Text
   Provides a text field (one line) and allows choosing a default value.

   Type
      Defines the type of the input field.
      This allows e.g. your browser to ensure that you provide the specific
      type.

      Currently available:

         * Email
         * Phone
         * Text
         * Url *(URL fields disable link-template availability)*

   Maxlength
      you can pick the maximum length of the field.

   .. hint::

      Select fields allow usage of
      :ref:`URL fields (Link Templates) <link-templates>`.

.. warning:: 

   You cannot change the object format / type as soon as it is applied.
   If you no longer need an object, consider disabling it instead of removing.

.. _link-templates:

URL fields (Link-Template)
--------------------------

.. note:: 

   This function is restricted to Text and Select objects only.

Link-Templates are an amazing way to dynamically generate URLs.
They allow you to integrate other systems better without having to
manually copy data from Zammad if possible.

   .. note::

      Another great way of communicating with another system may be Zammad's
      :doc:`Webhooks </manage/webhook>`.

After filling a link-template enabled field, an URL icon will appear on its
right. Clicking on the icon opens a new tab.

   .. hint:: 

      Even though Zammad displays the link template within object edit and
      create screens, the function is optional. It's only active if you populate
      the field.

How does this work...?!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As an example, let's say you have an object called ``amazingobject`` - you want
to open a google search directly with the input from that field.

Providing below to the link-template field allows you to do so:
``https://www.google.com/search?q=#{ticket.amazingobject}``

   .. tip::

      You can use any :doc:`Zammad variable </system/variables>` as long as
      it's available in the moment you need it.

The result will look as follows.

   The above screencast shows how the link template will perform after
   object creation.
