Troubleshooting
===============

All of the system's latest S/MIME activity
is displayed in the **Recent Logs** section.

   Logs report the status and details of all mail, both incoming and outgoing,
   that used signing/verification or encryption/decryption.

.. note:: This log does **not** include email
   sent by :doc:`triggers </manage/trigger>`
   or the :doc:`scheduler </manage/scheduler>`.
   For those, check your ``production.log``.

Common Issues
-------------

I received a signed/encrypted email before I set up S/MIME integration
   No problem.
   Once S/MIME has been enabled and the appropriate certificates have been added,
   agents will be prompted to retry verification/decryption on matching emails.
