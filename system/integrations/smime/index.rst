S/MIME is the most widely-supported method for secure email communication.
With S/MIME, you can exchange **signed** and **encrypted** messages with others.

Signing
   is proof that a message hasn't been tampered with or sent by an impersonator.

   In other words, it guarantees a message's **integrity** and **authenticity**.

Encryption
   scrambles a message so that it can only be unscrambled by the intended recipient.

   In other words, it guarantees **privacy** and **data security**.
