This integration enables Zammad to provide a caller log to your agents.
With this your agents can greet your customers by their name and are
supported by Zammad with automatically opening a new ticket dialogue or
the user profile.

If you want to learn more on how your agents can use this function, please
refer the `user documentation`_.

   .. note::

      Automatically opening new ticket dialogues or user profiles requires
      agent to extension mapping - see more below.

Limitations
-----------

Please note the following limitations to reduce confusion later on:

   * CTI integrations provide caller log functions only
   * This integration does not provide any VoIP functionalities;
     you can't make phone calls from within Zammad.
   * If your browser supports ``tel``-URLs, you can click on phone numbers
     for automatic dialing. This requires additional software / configuration
     on your agents computers.
