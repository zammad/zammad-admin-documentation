GitHub
======

Use GitHub integration to track GitHub issues directly within Zammad tickets.
Add links to issues and get meta information like status (open/closed),
assignee, labels and more.

Please note that our GitHub integration does not support pull requests.

Setup
-----

1. `Create a new API token in your GitHub profile <https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens>`_
   under *Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Fine-grained tokens*.
2. Add a name, set an expiration date and define the repository access. Don't
   add additional permissions.
3. Enter your new API token in Zammad and enable GitHub integration.
   Use the default API endpoint (``https://api.github.com/graphql``)
   unless you're using GitHub Enterprise Server.

Once completed, a new GitHub issues tab will appear in the ticket pane. ðŸŽ‰

Troubleshooting
---------------

Token verification is taking a long time
   Slight delays are normal (<2 min.), especially for systems under heavy load.

   Self-hosted administrators, please check your network settings
   to ensure that your Zammad server can reach ``api.github.com``.

I reloaded the page and now the API token is gone
   This may indicate that Zammad is still verifying your API token.
   Try reloading the page again in a couple minutes.
