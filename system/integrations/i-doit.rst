i-doit
======

`i-doit <https://www.i-doit.com/>`_ is an open-source
**configuration management database** - in other words, a tool for keeping tabs
on every single piece of your physical and digital infrastructure, from network
equipment to virtual machines on down to the faceplates on your rack shelves
and more.

What's that got to do with Zammad?
Well, if you used tickets to track issues with all that hardware,
you might start wishing there was a way they could talk to each other.

Zammad gives you two:

1. Add i-doit Links to Zammad Tickets

   The i-doit integration will appear under a new ðŸ–¨ tab in the ticket pane.

i-doit integration puts a new tab in Zammad's ticket pane
where you can add links to existing i-doit devices
for easy reference.
(See our
:user-docs:`user documentation </extras/i-doit-track-company-property.html>` to
learn how it works in practice).

How to set it up
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It requires i-doit's
`API Add-on <https://www.i-doit.com/i-doit/add-ons/api-add-on/>`_. Make sure to
have it properly set up. Use the following setting:

   * Active: ``Yes``
   * Enforce authentication by username and password: ``No``

To set it up, enable the integration in the Zammad admin panel
under **System > Integrations > i-doit**:

Endpoint
   The root URL of your i-doit installation.

API token
   Found in the i-doit admin panel
   under **Interfaces / external data > JSON-RPC API > Common Settings**.

Client ID
   A unique name to identify Zammad within i-doit.

   (Zammad does not require you to enter a value here, but i-doit might!)

SSL verification
   Here you can decide if the certificate of your i-doit system has to be
   verified or not. In case you are using custom certificates, please have
   a look at :doc:`how to add them to Zammad </settings/security/ssl-certificates>`.

2. List / Create Zammad Tickets in i-doit
-----------------------------------------

What users see
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   :align: center

i-doit's ticket system integration gives you a way to see
all the tickets for a given device without ever leaving i-doit.
(See our
:user-docs:`user documentation </extras/i-doit-track-company-property.html>` to
learn how it works in practice).

How to set it up
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Enable this integration in the i-doit admin panel under
**Interfaces / external data > Trouble Ticket System (TTS) > Configuration**:

.. figure:: /images/system/integrations/i-doit/trouble-ticket-system-configuration.png

   :align: center
   :width: 80%

TTS-Type
   ``Zammad``

Username / Password
   Login credentials for a Zammad agent.

   This agent must have **read permission** for all
   :doc:`groups </manage/groups/index>` that plan on using the i-doit
   integration.

   You may even wish to create a dedicated agent account just for this
   integration (otherwise, if the agent ever changes her password,
   you will have to remember to update it here).

URL incl. protocol
   ``https://your.zammad.domain``
