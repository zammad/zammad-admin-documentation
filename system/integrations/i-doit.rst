i-doit
======

`i-doit <https://www.i-doit.com/>`_ is an open-source
**configuration management database**â€”in other words,
a tool for keeping tabs on every single piece
of your physical and digital infrastructure,
from network equipment to virtual machines
on down to the faceplates on your rack shelves and more.

Whatâ€™s that got to do with Zammad?
Well, if you used tickets to track issues with all that hardware,
you might start wishing there was a way they could talk to each other.

Zammad gives you two:

1. Add i-doit Links to Zammad Tickets

   The i-doit integration will appear under a new ðŸ–¨ tab in the ticket pane.

i-doit integration puts a new tab in Zammadâ€™s ticket pane
where you can add links to existing i-doit devices
for easy reference.
(See our `user documentation <https://user-docs.zammad.org/en/latest/extras/i-doit-track-company-property.html>`_
to learn how it works in practice).

How to set it up

i-doitâ€™s ticket system integration gives you a way to see
all the tickets for a given device without ever leaving i-doit.
(See our `user documentation <https://user-docs.zammad.org/en/latest/extras/i-doit-track-company-property.html>`_
to learn how it works in practice).

      You may even wish to create a dedicated agent account just for this integration.
      (Otherwise, if the agent ever changes her password,
      you will have to remember to update it here.)
