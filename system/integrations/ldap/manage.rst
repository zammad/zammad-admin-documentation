Manage LDAP-Sources
-------------------

.. hint::

   Please keep in mind all current limitations for the LDAP synchronization.
   This will help to understand scopes of the following operations better.

Add new source
   Using the *New Source* button allows you to add new LDAP sources to your
   installations. You're not limited in the number of sources, however, keep
   in mind that many sources will also take more time to synchronize.

   If you want to use LDAPs, type ``ldaps://`` instead of ``ldap://`` in front
   of your hostname. You can also tell Zammad to use a different port by
   appending ``:<port number>``.

   When providing a LDAPs source, Zammad will display an additional option
   *SSL verification* that allows you to disable the verification for e.g.
   self-signed SSL certificates.

   .. tip::

      Using an user filter can be a good idea if you only require a small subset
      of your LDAP users in Zammad.

      This especially affects inactive users
         As every LDAP behaves differently on which attributes and how they are
         set, Zammad doesn't care about any flags.

         Users that no longer are returned by your LDAP source will
         automatically be set to inactive. Zammad assumes that the user was
         deactivated.

         Users will never be removed automatically!
         If you want to remove obsolete users, use :doc:`/system/data-privacy`.

      Active Directory admins
         Active Directories are quite specific on how to filter for active users
         only - please see the `Microsoft documentation`_ for more information.

   .. danger::

      *Do not* manually write pathes of either LDAP attributes or groups.
      If Zammad does not display them, it either cannot find them or you have
      a lot of users that don't have the attributes populated.

      Zammad will always only return attributes that are filled - this reduces
      the returned list of attributes greatly.

Review or edit existing source
   Clicking on a LDAP source will provide a configuration and mapping overview.

   If needed you can then use the *Change* button to update either the name,
   active state or the whole configuration. If you're changing the whole
   configuration, the dialogue will be identical to the source creation.

   .. note::

      Did your LDAP server change? Different LDAP servers have different
      structures and default attributes. This causes the LDAP synchronization
      to likely fail. Consider removing the affected source and re-add it.

Re-arrange LDAP source's order
   You can change the synchronization order for each source at any time.
   Zammad will synchronize the sources from top to bottom.

            drag and drop.

Remove a source
   If you no longer need the a LDAP source or simply want to start over,
   you can remove them at any time. This will not remove synchronized users,
   data synchronized or permissions.

   .. tip::

      Not sure if you'd need the source later on? Set the source to inactive
      instead of removing it - see *Review or edit existing source* for more.
