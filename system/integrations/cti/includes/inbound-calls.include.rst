This option allows you to block specific incoming caller IDs.
It allows you to temporarily reject e.g. spam callers without having to
contact providers or PBX administrators.

Caller ID to block
   Provide caller IDs to block in ``E.164`` format.

Note
   Provide a meaningful note for your fellow administrators to remind
   yourself why you've chosen to block the number.
