This integration enables Zammad to provide a caller log to your agents.
With this your agents can greet your customers by their name and are
supported by Zammad with automatically opening a new ticket dialog or
the user profile.

Click the toggle next to the heading to activate or
deactivate this integration.

If you want to learn more on how your agents can use this function, please
refer the :user-docs:`user documentation </extras/caller-log.html>`.

.. note::

  Automatically opening new ticket dialogues or user profiles requires
  agent to extension mapping - see more below.

Limitations
-----------

Please note the following limitations to reduce confusion later on:

* CTI integrations provide caller log functions only.
* This integration does not provide any VoIP functionalities;
  you can't make phone calls from within Zammad.
* If your browser supports ``tel``-URLs, you can click on phone numbers
  for automatic dialing. This requires additional software / configuration
  on your agent's computers.
