By mapping your agents extension to their existing Zammad users,
Zammad can provide a new ticket dialogue or open the user profile for
the agent that picks up the call.

This speeds up ticket aiding, no matter if it's for existing tickets or new
ones!

   .. note::

      The agent perspective is described within our `user documentation`_.
