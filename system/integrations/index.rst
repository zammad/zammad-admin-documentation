Integrations
============

Zammad offers numerous integrations that add rich features to your instance.

.. note:: We're still working on this part of our documentation, stay tight!


Integrations for Phone Systems
------------------------------

.. hint::

   Your VoIP provider or telephony system is not listed?
   Possibly your provider supports Zammad by using the generic CTI - if you're
   unsure ask your provider.

   Provider does not support Zammad?
   Consider creating a
   `feature request in the Zammad Community <https://community.zammad.org/c/stuff-you-like-zammad-to-have-feel-free-to-discuss-and-add-proposals/6>`_.
