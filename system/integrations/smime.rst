S/MIME
======

.. note:: S/MIME integration has been introduced with Zammad 3.4.

What the S/MIME integration can do for you
------------------------------------------

The S/MIME integration allows you to ecrypt/decrypt and sign/verify mails. 
This documentation assumes that you already have S/MIME certificates, generation of these certificates is out of 
scope.

You can import certificates by

  * importing a complete ca (public certificate) to verify e.g. internal signed mails,
  * importing a public certificate and private key to sign outgoing mails for the mail address configured within 
    the certificate or
  * importing a public certificate of a specific user you've been provided to verify the mail content.

This integration **does not** come with automatic trusted CAs, as Zammad can't predict which use base is valid to you.

Where to get S/MIME certificates from?
--------------------------------------

You can get S/MIME certificates from different sources by

  * self-signing certificates with your own CA or
  * obtain (buy) public available certificates.

The biggest downside on self signed certificates is that your recipient can't verify your authenticity without 
importing *your* CA certificate. 

There are just a few providers that provide S/MIME certificates. Examples would be (not affiated):

  * Secerio
  * Comodo

How to configure the S/MIME integration?
----------------------------------------

.. note:: You can't add certificate and private key in one step. If you have a combined file containing both, just upload it 
  within certificate and private key context. Zammad will automatically extract the correct part it needs.

To configure and activate Zammads S/MIME integration, just navigate to Integrations â†’ S/MIME. 
Here you can activate the S/MIME functionality itself. If activated, this will add new options to :doc:`/manage/trigger` and :doc:`/manage/scheduler` options. 
Also, your agents will now see a "sign" and "encrypt" button above article creation and within new ticket dialogues.

.. hint:: By default Zammad will always encrypt and sign an outgoing mail. Your agent has to disable it manually. 
  This is, if suitable certificates are found. (_`Addressing issues` might help you to understand scopes better)

Zammad will display all configured certificates within the table. This allows you to see if an customer email address 
is already known, when the certificate became valid and when it will expire. 

If you added a private key, Zammad will provide a short information by adding "Including private key." below the certificate 
the private key belongs to.

Public certificate and private key are needed together for your sending channel. This allows you to sign and encrypt [#]_ emails within Zammad. The public certificate of a sender is required for Zammad to check the validy of the signature or decrypt a received message.

.. [#] Encryption of emails requires you to provide the recipients public certificate. You can only encrypt emails for *one recipient*.

Providing certificates
++++++++++++++++++++++

Add a certificate
  It all starts with the certificate. With this step you'll add either your own certificate (for an outgoing email address) or 
  the certificate of your e.g. customer. You can choose to either upload the certificate as a file [#crtfile]_ or to paste the certificate content into the text field.
  
  If you're ready click on "Add" to save the certificate within Zammad.

Add a private key
  A private key is only required for Zammads email addresses. With this step you'll add your own private key for your certificate to Zammad. 
  You can choose to either upload the private key as a file [#crtfile]_ or to paste the private key content into the text field.

  If you're ready click on "Add" to save the private key within Zammad.
  Zammad will automatically detect the correct certificate to assign the private key to.

.. [#crtfile] You can supply a pem/cer file that contains both, the certificate and private key. Zammad will extract what it needs, depending on the dialogue you're in.

.. hint:: Imported a certificate after receiving a mail?
   No problem, if the integration has been enabled, Zammad allows your 
   agent to re-check on failed verifications or decryptions!

How to work with the S/MIME integration?
----------------------------------------

Working with S/MIME from agent point of view is out of scope of this documentation. 
However, you can find further information about this topic `here <https://user-docs.zammad.org/en/latest/advanced/security-and-encryption.html>`_.

Addressing issues
-----------------

This section can help you if you encounter issues while using S/MIME within Zammad.

Checking for issues with the integration
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Zammad comes with a log that shows if there were issues with in- or outgoing emails. 
This covers signing, signing verification, encryption and decryption.

.. figure:: /images/system/smime/smime-log.png
   :alt: Sample entries of in- and outgoing S/MIME related emails.
   :align: center

.. hint:: This log does not cover :doc:`/manage/trigger` or :doc:`/manage/scheduler` based emails!
   For those mails you'll need to have a look in your ``production.log`` for hints what went wrong.

Common Issues you might encounter
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

There are some cases that we can cover to at least help you into the right direction. 
If you're encountering an issue with the integration, the following list might help you.

I can see "Encrypt" and "Sign", however, can't click or activate these buttons.
  This might have three reasons:
  
  1. The mail address configured within the group your agent tries to sign the mail does not match the mail address 
     that's configured within your certificate.

        .. note:: This also affects :doc:`/manage/trigger` and :doc:`/manage/scheduler` if they're supposed to encrypt emails!
  2. While you've provided a certificate, it's missing the private key. Check the certificate list and search for the 
     string "Including private key.".
  3. You provided an invalid certificate that's not suitable for S/MIME.

I can activate "Sign", but can't use "Encrypt"?!
  In order to encrypt emails, you'll need the public certificate of your recipient. If Zammad doesn't know the 
  recipients certificate, it can't allow you to encrypt the email in question.

When adding a new certificate, I get the error `Fingerprint already taken`??
  This exception occurs if you already added a certificate with the same fingerprint. Ensure it's not already 
  present in your installation.
