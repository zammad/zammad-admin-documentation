Group
   Which :doc:`group </manage/groups/index>` should Checkmk tickets be assigned
   to as a default (*i.e.,* when none is specified)?

   (Applies to :ref:`API alerts <checkmk-api-alerts>` only.)

Auto close
   Should Zammad automatically close tickets if a service has recovered on
   its own?

   (Agents will receive notifications for such closures as appropriate.)

Auto-close state
   What ticket state should be applied when ‚Äúauto-closing‚Äù a ticket?

   (You may choose from the seven built-in ticket states,
   but if you change this setting from the default, you‚Äôll more likely want to
   :docs:`define a new ticket state </admin/console.html>` for this
   purpose. This can be especially useful for tracking tickets with
   :doc:`reports </manage/report-profiles>`.)

If you‚Äôre having trouble getting Zammad and Checkmk to play nicely together,
this section can help you troubleshoot. üôå

It contains a record of the fifty most recent transactions that Zammad knows
about, including each one‚Äôs request/response details and return status.
