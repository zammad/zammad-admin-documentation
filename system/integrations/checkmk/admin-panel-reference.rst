Group
   Which :doc:`group </manage/groups>` should Checkmk tickets be assigned to
   as a default (*i.e.,* when none is specified)?

   (Applies to :ref:`API alerts <checkmk-api-alerts>` only.)

Auto close
   Should Zammad automatically close tickets if a service has recovered on its own?

   (Agents will receive notifications for such closures as appropriate.)

Auto close state
   What ticket state should be applied when “auto-closing” a ticket?

   (You may choose from the seven built-in ticket states,
   but if you change this setting from the default,
   you’ll more likely want to
   `define a new ticket state <https://docs.zammad.org/en/latest/admin/console.html>`_
   for this purpose.
   This can be especially useful for tracking tickets with
   :doc:`reports </manage/report-profiles>`.)

If you’re having trouble getting Zammad and Checkmk to play nicely together,
this section can help you troubleshoot. 🙌

It contains a record of the fifty most recent transactions that Zammad knows about,
including each one’s request/response details and return status.
