System Report
=============

In this place you can't configure Zammad. Instead you can obtain a system
report about Zammad and its configuration.

See the description in Zammad for an explanation. You can even find a preview
of the included data below the **Download** button.

.. note:: Zammad never sends this automatically to anyone. It is a manual
   process only to provide better support based on your configuration.
