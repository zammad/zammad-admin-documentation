Core Workflows
==============

Core workflows allow you to adjust object attributes in many ways.
For example:

* Show and hide fields
* Adjust if fields are mandatory or not
* Set available options for select fields

This allows you to provide exactly the information that your users really need.

.. note::

   * If the pre-defined :doc:`object attributes</system/objects>` are not enough,
     please add custom object attributes first.
   * If you experience slow or unreliable field updates, please see
     :ref:`Core Workflow Ajax Modus <core-workflow-ajax-mode>`
   * This is a very enhanced functionality and can cause unexpected UI behavior.
     Please ensure to test your use cases after configuration to reduce
     surprises.
