Core Workflows
==============

Core Workflows allow you to adjust object attributes in many ways.
For example:

   * show / hide fields
   * adjust mandatory setting
   * manipulate available options

With this, you can provide exactly the information your users really need!

.. note::

   * If the pre-defined :doc:`/system/objects` are not enough,
     please add them beforehand.
   * If you experience slow or unreliable field updates, please see
     :ref:`Core Workflow Ajax Modus <core-workflow-ajax-mode>`

.. warning::

   This is a very enhanced functionality and can cause unexpected UI behavior.
   Please ensure to test your use cases after configuration to reduce surprises.
