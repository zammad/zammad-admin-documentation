      Usually the instance owner (the person that registered the instance) will
      receive all emails including the invoices. In case you have your own
      billing department, you can provide their email address here.

      All billing relevant information will then be sent to this email address.

      .. hint::

         Invoices are sent as attachment (PDF) to this email address.

   Don't forget to press the *Submit* button after you changed above settings.
