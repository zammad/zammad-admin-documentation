FAQ
---

I set up a trial account but am missing functions to test
   The trial instance is running within the professional package
   allowing up to three agents.

Can I change package within the trial?
   No. As soon as the package is changed the subscription begins.

What happens to my trial instance after the trial period ended?
   Your instance will automatically be canceled for you.
   Please see *What happens to my instance after it has been canceled?*
   for more.

What happens to my instance after it has been canceled?
   That depends slightly on your instance state:

   Trial instance
      If you're still on trial, we will ice your instance and remind you once
      again about your instance. We then will wait some days and remove your
      instance from our system. This is the last time we will inform you by
      Email.

   Paid instance
      If you're a paying customer and canceled your subscription, the instance
      removal will take place the day after your last subscription day.

Can removed instances be restored?
   No. Once your instance has been removed, a restoration is not possible.
