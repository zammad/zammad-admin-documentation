Additional Customization
========================

Automation for Incoming Messages
--------------------------------

There are different ways in Zammad how to automate things. Namely triggers,
schedulers and macros. By default, there is already one active trigger which
sends out auto-reply emails to customers after they contacted you in a new
support case. You can even decide in the channel configuration, where specific
messages should be dispatched to.

Add Text Modules
----------------

Text modules/templates are a nice time saver for your agents. In case they
answer similar questions over and over again and/or you want to unify their
answers, add text modules for that. 

Adjust and Add Overviews
------------------------


Enable Checklist Feature
------------------------

For a quick start, watch the video about enabling the checklist feature and
adding a default checklist.

Next Steps
----------

Depending on your use case, you might want to adjust more things. Have a look
at the left navigation menu where you can find a detailled explanation of
more all features in Zammad.

- To provide more ways for your customers to contact you, add additional
  channels like :doc:`/channels/whatsapp/index` and :doc:`/channels/sms`.
- Leverage productivity by:

   - Automate additional things via :doc:`/manage/trigger`,
     :doc:`/manage/scheduler` and :doc:`/manage/macros`
   - Use :doc:`AI features </ai/provider>` to relieve your agents so they can
     focus on more important tasks.

- In case you want to bill the support provided, use the
  :doc:`time accounting </manage/time-accounting>` feature
- Add your own custom fields for users or tickets where you can add needed
  information. You can do so in the :doc:`object attributes </system/objects>`
  section in Zammad.
