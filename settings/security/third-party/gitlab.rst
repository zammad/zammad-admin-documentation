Gitlab
======

It is possible to create a quick login for your helpdesk via Gitlab.
To activate the quick login you need to enable OAuth for Gitlab.

Register Gitlab App
-------------------

To register an app in Gitlab open your profile and select applications.

As callback URL enter "https://zammad-fqdn/auth/gitlab/callback"
where zammad-fqdn has to be replaced with your Zammad FQDN

Just select *read_user* under scopes as in the screenshot and save it.

Configure Zammad as Gitlab App
------------------------------

Enter the "APP ID" and the "APP SECRET" from the Gitlab OAUTH Applications
Dashboard and your Gitlab-URL in the "SITE" field.

After you configured the Gitlab credentials and activated
the login method, you should see a new icon on the login page.

If you click on the icon you will be redirected to Gitlab and see something
similar to this:

When you grant the access you will be redirected to your Zammad instance
and logged in as a customer.


Now you can link accounts via "Avatar -> Profile -> Link Accounts" or login via
Zammad login page.
