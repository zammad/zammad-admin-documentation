Zammads Microsoft connection allows your users with Microsoft accounts to login. 
This works for Azure users as well and can be an alternative to 
:doc:`/system/integrations/ldap`.

.. hint:: **This login function was called "Office 365" prior Zammad 5.1.**

.. note::

   This documentation part does not cover our 
   :doc:`ðŸ“§ Microsoft 365 email channel </channels/microsoft365/index>`.

Limitations
-----------

Supported account types:
   Please note that Zammad only supports these account types (App dependent):

      * Accounts in this organizational directory only 
        (Default Directory only - Single tenant)
      * Accounts in any organizational directory 
        (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant)
      * Accounts in any organizational directory 
        (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant) 
        and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox)

Avatars of signing in users:
   Zammad currently ignores user avatars. If the user is registered with 
   e.g. Gravatar, Zammad will fetch the avatar from there if enabled. 
   See :doc:`Zammad Image Service </settings/system/index>` for more.

Step 1 - Register a Microsoft app for Zammad
--------------------------------------------

Login to the `Microsoft Azure Portal <https://portal.azure.com/>`_ 
and navigate to App registrations to create a new app. 
Provide the requested information as follows and register your app. 

Name:
   Any meaningful name fitting, this name will be displayed to users 
   trying to authenticate with this app.

Supported account types:
   Choose one of the above mentioned account types (see Limitations).

   .. tip::

      The correct account type depends on your use case. 
      If you want to use the authentication internal only, choose the first 
      option. If you're unsure, use the "Help me choose..." link.

Redirect URI (optional):
   Select web and provide your callback url. 
   The callback url looks like this: 
   ``https://zammad.domain.tld/auth/microsoft_office365/callback``
