Two-Factor Authentication
=========================

Two-factor authentication (2FA) enhances the security of Zammad accounts by
adding an extra layer of verification beyond a password. It requires users to
provide two different types of authentication factors, typically something they
know (like a password) and something they possess (like a mobile device or a
security token), to ensure that only authorized individuals can access the
account.

Enable Recovery Codes
---------------------

.. warning::
   Recovery codes cannot be used on their own, they can only be activated if at
   least one two-factor authentication method is enabled.

Recovery codes are one-time use security codes that can be used by the user if
they lose access to their other two-factor authentication methods.

Recovery codes can only be used as a backup method. If enabled, they will be
automatically generated for the user once they set up their initial two-factor
authentication method.

The user will be asked to print out or save the generated recovery codes in a
safe place. Once used, a recovery code cannot be reused.

Users will also have an option to regenerate their recovery codes at any time,
which invalidates already existing recovery codes and provides them with a list
of fresh codes.

.. hint::
   After you enable this setting, when the user completes a setup of their
   initial two-factor authentication method, they will be presented with a list
   of recovery codes and instructed to save them for later use.

Enforce the set up of the two-factor authentication
---------------------------------------------------

.. warning::
   You must have at least one two-factor authentication method enabled for this
   setting to take effect.

In case you wish to require your users to set up at least one two-factor
authentication method for their account, you can do this by selecting specific
user roles the requirement applies to in **Enforced for user roles** setting.

.. hint::
   After you change this setting, if the user has one of the selected roles on
   their account, they will be forced to set up the two-factor authentication
   upon next sign in or application reload.

   A modal dialog with instructions will be shown, and they will not be able to
   do any work before they set up at least one two-factor method.
