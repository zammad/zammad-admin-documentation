First Steps
===========

After the basic setup of Zammad with the getting started wizard, you will see
hints how to use the UI (see "Intro" below if you want to see them again).

After these hints, the dashboard is presented to you which is basically the
Zammad start page. This dashboard provides some useful information for the
agents.

You can switch to the "First Steps" section on top of the page to see useful
links for the start. Depending on your configuration and permission, your list
may look different.

Configuration
-------------

Branding
   Link to the :doc:`branding section in the settings </settings/branding>`.

Your Email Configuration
   Link to the
   :doc:`email channel section in the settings </channels/email/index>`.

.. _invite-agents:

Invite agents/colleagues to help working on tickets
   Here you can invite agents/colleagues to work with you in Zammad.
   It opens a dialog in which you can provide details and assign a role.

   Make sure to have configured the
   :doc:`roles and permission </manage/roles/index>` according to your
   needs before inviting. To send the invitations via email, you have to
   configure an
   :doc:`email notification channel </channels/email/accounts/email-notification>`
   before too.

Invite customers to create issues in Zammad
   Similar to the invitation of agents, you can invite customers
   to create tickets/articles and to view them in the web UI. Of course, your
   customers can create tickets anyway if they send you an email to a
   address which is configured as an email channel. They even get an account
   created automatically. For more information, a good starting point is the
   :doc:`users section </manage/users/index>`.
