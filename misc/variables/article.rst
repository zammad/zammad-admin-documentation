.. note:: If you're missing variables or are not sure if something is not working as expected, feel free to ask over at the `Community <https://community.zammad.org>`_.

Below you can find all available ticket article-based variables within Zammad.
These can be called via Triggers for example. If you're unsure if Zammad does support variables at the point you're at, you can try to type ``::`` to check.

The below list gives you an example what kind of data you can expect, it's not intended to explain the data itself.
