Object Conditions
*****************

In many places in Zammad you can use conditions based on attribute checks to
filter tickets and perform actions.

Please note that the availability of the different attributes and special fields
depend on the feature you are using and the object context.

This guide is split into two sections:

:doc:`/misc/object-conditions/basics`
   Learn how Zammad's conditions work to adapt to your environment.

:doc:`/misc/object-conditions/expert-mode`
   Learn how Zammad's expert mode for conditions allows you to create
   even more powerful conditions with AND/OR relations.
