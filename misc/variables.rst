Variables
=========

Use variables in text modules, triggers and many other places in Zammad to
dynamically reflect information from object attributes.

.. note:: Please note that this is just an overview of available variables.
   It might be incomplete or variables might not be available within some
   functions. If you're missing variables or are not sure if something is not
   working as expected, feel free to ask over at the
   `community <https://community.zammad.org>`_.

Basic Usage
-----------

Variables can be called by typing ``::`` (just like text modules in the
frontend), as long as you're in a supported text field in the settings.
Zammad will display all variables being available within this context and
add the variable to your text as soon as you selected an entry. You can even
search for and use variables for custom object attributes.

After selecting a variable, it is displayed in a structure like this:
``#{object.attribute}``

.. hint:: You have an empty field which you referenced and it appears as ``-``?
   That's currently working as designed - you might want to ensure that these
   fields always have a value.

Variable Categories
-------------------

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   variables/config
   variables/current-user
   variables/article
   variables/ticket

Structure
---------

The first part of the variable name consist of the object type, e.g. ``ticket``,
``config``, ``user``.

The second part is the name of the attribute. For custom object attributes, this
is the name you defined for the attribute and can be found in the object
attribute menu at any time.
The first and second part of a variable is divided by a point,
e.g.: ``ticket.number`` which will in total be ``#{ticket.number}``.

In some situations it might be needed to use a third part.
The best example for such a situation is a **select** or **tree-select**
field which will return the key value by default, not it's display name.
For this, just extend your variable with ``.value``. This will result in
``#{ticket.select.value}``.

Using Translated Variables
--------------------------

If you want to use a translated variable in triggers or
schedulers, you can extend the placeholder like this:
``#{t(ticket.state.name)}``. The ``t`` tells Zammad to search for fitting
translated strings. The used output language is based on the system language of
Zammad which you can set in the admin panel under :doc:`/settings/branding` or
based on the selected locale in the trigger/scheduler edit dialog.

A possible use-case: you want to send your customers updates on tickets
via trigger or scheduler which should include the state of the ticket. Using the
default ``#{ticket.state.name}`` (without the translation flag ``t()``) would
lead to the output of the original (english) name of the state.

Date and Time Formatting
------------------------

The system (trigger/scheduler selected) locale and timezone predefines a default
format of date and timestamp. This format is customizable by using the ``dt()``
method.

The method arguments are as follows:

1. The date or timestamp variable you want to format.
2. The output format string.
3. The timezone to apply (optional).

| **Example:**
| ``#{dt(ticket.updated_at, "%A %Y-%m-%d %H:%M in the office", "Europe/Berlin")}``
| Monday, 2024-03-18 15:31 in the office

.. hint:: If you want to use our example, make sure to paste the
   string above without formatting (:kbd:`CTRL` :kbd:`Shift` :kbd:`v`),
   otherwise it won't work.

The following table lists available format directives:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 30 55
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
     - Note
   * - ``%Y``
     - Year with 4 digits
     - Use ``%y`` for year with 2 digits
   * - ``%m``
     - Month of year (as number with zero-padding)
     - Use ``%-m`` for month without zero-padding
   * - ``%d``
     - Day of month (as number with zero-padding)
     - Use ``%e`` for day without zero-padding
   * - ``%H``
     - Hour of day in 24h notation with zero-padding
     - Use ``%k`` for hour without zero-padding
   * - ``%I``
     - Hour of day in 12h notation with zero-padding
     - Use ``%l`` for hour without zero-padding and ``%p`` / ``%P`` for meridian indicator
   * - ``%M``
     - Minute of hour
     -
   * - ``%S``
     - Second of Minute
     -
   * - ``%A``
     - Weekday name
     - Use ``%a`` for abbreviated name or ``%^A`` for uppercase name
   * - ``%B``
     - Month name
     - Use ``%b`` for abbreviated name
   * - ``%U``
     - Week number of current year
     - Use ``%W`` for a different calculation method

.. tip::
   We support the known format directives for
   the Ruby built-in method ``strftime`` of the ``DateTime`` class.
